To avoid unnecessary dependencies on functions from non-standard MathWorks toolboxes, FieldTrip includes a number of drop-in replacement functions that have the same functionality as their MATLAB counterparts. Have a look at [this FAQ](/faq/can_i_prevent_external_toolboxes_from_being_added_to_my_matlab_path) how you can control whether these are added to your path.
