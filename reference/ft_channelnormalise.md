title: ft_channelnormalise

```
 FT_CHANNELNORMALISE shifts and scales all channels of the the input data.
 The default behavior is to subtract each channel's mean, and scale to a
 standard deviation of 1, for each channel individually.

 Use as
   [dataout] = ft_channelnormalise(cfg, data)

 The configuration can contain
   cfg.channel = 'all', or a selection of channels
   cfg.trials  = 'all' or a selection given as a 1xN vector (default = 'all')
   cfg.demean  = 'yes' or 'no' (or boolean value) (default = 'yes')
   cfg.scale   = scalar value used for scaling (default = 1)
   cfg.method  = 'perchannel', or 'acrosschannel', computes the
                   standard deviation per channel, or across all channels.
                   The latter method leads to the same scaling across
                   channels and preserves topographical distributions

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
