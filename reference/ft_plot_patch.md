```
 FT_PLOT_PATCH plot a colored shape, similar to the MATLAB patch() function. It is 
 similar in usage as ft_plot_vector, and they can be combined, for example,
 to plot an area equivalent to a SEM or STD-DEV around a line.

 Use as
   ft_plot_patch(X, Y, ...)
 where X and Y are similar as the input to the MATLAB patch() function.

 Optional arguments should come in key-value pairs and can include
   'axis'            = draw the local axis,  can be 'yes', 'no', 'xy', 'x' or 'y'
   'box'             = draw a box around the local axes, can be 'yes' or 'no'
   'tag'             = string, the name assigned to the object. All tags with the same name can be deleted in a figure, without deleting other parts of the figure.
   'facecolor'       = see MATLAB standard patch properties 
   'facealpha'       = see MATLAB standard patch properties (note, approx. transparency can be achieved using 'facecolor')
   'edgecolor'       = see MATLAB standard patch properties (default is 'none') (equivalent to 'linecolor' in PLOT)
   'linestyle'       = see MATLAB standard patch properties 
   'linewidth'       = see MATLAB standard patch properties 

 The color of the patchand the edges (i.e. border lines) can be specified in a variety of ways
   - as a string with one character per line that you want to plot. Supported colors are the same as in PATCH, i.e. 'bgrcmykw'.
   - as an 'RGB triplet', a 1x3 vector with values between 0 and 1
   - as 'none' if you do not want the face of the patch to be filled (useful when you want to plot an empty box).

 It is possible to plot the object in a local pseudo-axis (c.f. subplot), which is specfied as follows
   'hpos'            = horizontal position of the center of the local axes
   'vpos'            = vertical position of the center of the local axes
   'width'           = width of the local axes
   'height'          = height of the local axes
   'hlim'            = horizontal scaling limits within the local axes
   'vlim'            = vertical scaling limits within the local axes

 Example
   hdat = [1:10 10:-1:1];
   vdat = rand(1,10);
   vdat = [vdat vdat(end:-1:1)+1];
   ft_plot_patch(hdat, vdat)
