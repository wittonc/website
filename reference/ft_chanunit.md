```
 FT_CHANUNIT is a helper function that tries to determine the physical
 units of each channel. In case the type of channel is not detected, it
 will return 'unknown' for that channel.

 Use as
   unit = ft_chanunit(hdr)
 or as
   unit = ft_chanunit(hdr, desired)

 If the desired unit is not specified as second input argument, this
 function returns a Nchan*1 cell-array with a string describing the
 physical units of each channel, or 'unknown' if those cannot be
 determined.

 If the desired unit is specified as second input argument, this function
 returns a Nchan*1 boolean vector with "true" for the channels that match
 the desired physical units and "false" for the ones that do not match.

 The specification of the channel units depends on the acquisition system,
 for example the neuromag306 system includes channel with the following
 units: uV, T and T/cm.
