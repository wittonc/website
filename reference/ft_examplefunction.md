```
 FT_EXAMPLEFUNCTION demonstrates to new developers how a FieldTrip function should look like

 Use as
   outdata = ft_examplefunction(cfg, indata)
 where indata is <<describe the type of data or where it comes from>>
 and cfg is a configuration structure that should contain

 <<note that the cfg list should be indented with two spaces

  cfg.option1    = value, explain the value here (default = something)
  cfg.option2    = value, describe the value here and if needed
                   continue here to allow automatic parsing of the help

 The configuration can optionally contain
   cfg.option3   = value, explain it here (default is automatic)

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
