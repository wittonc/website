title: ft_appendfreq

```
 FT_APPENDFREQ concatenates multiple frequency or time-frequency data structures
 that have been processed separately. If the input data structures contain different
 channels, it will be concatenated along the channel direction. If the channels are
 identical in the input data structures, the data will be concatenated along the
 repetition dimension.

 Use as
  combined = ft_appendfreq(cfg, freq1, freq2, ...)

 The configuration should contain
   cfg.parameter  = string, the name of the field to concatenate

 The configuration can optionally contain
   cfg.appenddim  = string, the dimension to concatenate over (default is automatic)
   cfg.tolerance  = scalar, tolerance to determine how different the frequency and/or
                    time axes are allowed to still be considered compatible (default = 1e-5)

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a
 *.mat file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file.
 These mat files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with
 the input/output structure.
