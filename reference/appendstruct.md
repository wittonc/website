```
 APPENDSTRUCT appends a structure to a structure or struct-array.
 It also works if the initial structure is an empty structure or
 an empty double array. It also works if the input structures have 
 different fields.

 Use as
   ab = appendstruct(a, b)

 See also PRINTSTRUCT, COPYFIELDS, KEEPFIELDS, REMOVEFIELDS
