 FT_SOURCESTATISTICS computes the probability for a given null-hypothesis using
 a parametric statistical test or using a non-parametric randomization test.

 Use as
   [stat] = ft_sourcestatistics(cfg, source1, source2, ...)
 where the input data is the result from FT_SOURCEANALYSIS, FT_SOURCEDESCRIPTIVES
 or FT_SOURCEGRANDAVERAGE.  The source structures should be spatially alligned
 to each other and should have the same positions for the sourcemodel.

 The configuration should contain the following option for data selection
   cfg.parameter  = string, describing the functional data to be processed, e.g. 'pow', 'nai' or 'coh'

 Furthermore, the configuration should contain:
   cfg.method       = different methods for calculating the probability of the null-hypothesis,
                    'montecarlo'    uses a non-parametric randomization test to get a Monte-Carlo estimate of the probability,
                    'analytic'      uses a parametric test that results in analytic probability,
                    'stats'         (soon deprecated) uses a parametric test from the MATLAB statistics toolbox,

 The other cfg options depend on the method that you select. You
 should read the help of the respective subfunction FT_STATISTICS_XXX
 for the corresponding configuration options and for a detailed
 explanation of each method.
