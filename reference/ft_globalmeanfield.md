 FT_GLOBALMEANFIELD calculates global mean field amplitude or power of input data

 Use as
   [gmf] = ft_globalmeanfield(cfg, data)

 The data should be organised in a structure as obtained from the
 FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS function. The configuration should be according to
 FT_PREPROCESSING function. The configuration should be according to

   cfg.method    = string, determines whether the amplitude or power should be calculated (see below, default is 'amplitude', can be 'power')
   cfg.channel   = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
                            see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details

 This function calculates the global mean field power, or amplitude,
 as described in:
 Lehmann D, Skrandies W. Reference-free identification of components of
 checkerboard-evoked multichannel potential fields. Electroencephalogr Clin
 Neurophysiol. 1980 Jun;48(6):609-21. PubMed PMID: 6155251.

 Please note that to calculate what is clasically referred to as Global
 Mean Field Power, cfg.method must be 'amplitude'. The naming implies a
 squared measure but this is not the case.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
