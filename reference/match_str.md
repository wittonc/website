```
 MATCH_STR looks for matching labels in two lists of strings
 and returns the indices into both the 1st and 2nd list of the matches.
 They will be ordered according to the first input argument.

 Use as
   [sel1, sel2] = match_str(strlist1, strlist2)

 The strings can be stored as a char matrix or as an vertical array of
 cells, the matching is done for each row.

 When including a 1 as the third input argument, the output lists of
 indices will be expanded to the size of the largest input argument.
 Entries that occur only in one of the two inputs will correspond to a 0
 in the output, in this case. This can be convenient in rare cases if the
 size of the input lists is meaningful.
