```
 BCIFUN_LATIDX extracts alpha power, computes the alpha lateralization index 
 and sends a command to an external device

 This function computes the lateralization index log(A/B) for the
 average alpha power in right channels A and the average alpha power
 in left channels B. In a covert attention experiment we expect
 higher values for attention to the right visual hemifield and lower
 values for attention to the left visual hemifield.
