 FT_COMPUTE_LEADFIELD computes a forward solution for a dipole in a a volume
 conductor model. The forward solution is expressed as the leadfield
 matrix (Nchan*3), where each column corresponds with the potential or field
 distributions on all sensors for one of the x,y,z-orientations of the
 dipole.

 Use as
   [lf] = ft_compute_leadfield(dippos, sens, headmodel, ...)
 with input arguments
   dippos    = position dipole (1*3 or Ndip*3)
   sens      = structure with gradiometer or electrode definition
   headmodel = structure with volume conductor definition

 The headmodel represents a volume conductor model, its contents
 depend on the type of model. The sens structure represents a sensor
 array, i.e. EEG electrodes or MEG gradiometers.

 It is possible to compute a simultaneous forward solution for EEG and MEG
 by specifying sens and grad as two cell-arrays, e.g.
   sens       = {senseeg, sensmeg}
   headmodel  = {voleeg,  volmeg}
 This results in the computation of the leadfield of the first element of
 sens and headmodel, followed by the second, etc. The leadfields of the
 different imaging modalities are subsequently concatenated.

 Additional input arguments can be specified as key-value pairs, supported
 optional arguments are
   'reducerank'      = 'no' or number
   'normalize'       = 'no', 'yes' or 'column'
   'normalizeparam'  = parameter for depth normalization (default = 0.5)
   'weight'          = number or 1xN vector, weight for each dipole position (default = 1)
   'backproject'     = 'yes' (default) or 'no', in the case of a rank reduction
                       this parameter determines whether the result will be
                       backprojected onto the original subspace

 The leadfield weight may be used to specify a (normalized)
 corresponding surface area for each dipole, e.g. when the dipoles
 represent a folded cortical surface with varying triangle size.

 Depending on the specific input arguments for the sensor and volume, this
 function will select the appropriate low-level EEG or MEG forward model.
 The leadfield matrix for EEG will have an average reference over all the
 electrodes.

 The supported forward solutions for MEG are
   infinite homogenous medium
   single sphere (Cuffin and Cohen, 1977)
   multiple spheres with one sphere per channel (Huang et al, 1999)
   realistic single shell using superposition of basis functions (Nolte, 2003)
   leadfield interpolation using a precomputed sourcemodel
   boundary element method (BEM)

 The supported forward solutions for EEG are
   infinite homogenous medium
   infinite halfspace homogenous medium
   single sphere
   multiple concentric spheres (up to 4 spheres)
   leadfield interpolation using a precomputed sourcemodel
   boundary element method (BEM)
