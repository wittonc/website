 FT_DENOISE_PREWHITEN applies a spatial prewhitening operation to the data using the
 inverse noise covariance matrix. The consequence is that all channels are expressed
 in singnal-to-noise units, causing different channel types to be comparable. This
 ensures equal weighting in source estimation on data with different channel types.

 Use as
   dataout = ft_denoise_prewhiten(cfg, datain, noise)
 where the datain is the original data from FT_PREPROCESSING and
 noise should contain the estimated noise covariance from
 FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS.

 The configuration structure can contain
   cfg.channel     = cell-array, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION (default = 'all')
   cfg.split       = cell-array of channel types between which covariance is split, it can also be 'all' or 'no'
   cfg.lambda      = scalar, or string, regularization parameter for the inverse
   cfg.kappa       = scalar, truncation parameter for the inverse

 The channel selection relates to the channels that are pre-whitened using the same
 selection of channels in the noise covariance. All channels present in the input
 data structure will be present in the output, including trigger and other auxiliary
 channels.
