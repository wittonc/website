```
 FT_VOLUMEREALIGN spatially aligns an anatomical MRI with head coordinates based on
 external fiducials or anatomical landmarks. This function does not change the
 anatomical MRI volume itself, but only adjusts the homogeneous transformation
 matrix that describes the mapping from voxels to the coordinate system. It also
 appends a coordsys-field to the output data, or it updates it. This field specifies
 how the x/y/z-axes of the coordinate system should be interpreted.

 For spatial normalisation and deformation (i.e. warping) an MRI to a template brain
 you should use the FT_VOLUMENORMALISE function.

 Different methods for aligning the anatomical MRI to a coordinate system are
 implemented, which are described in detail below:

 INTERACTIVE - Use a graphical user interface to click on the location of anatomical
 landmarks or fiducials. The anatomical data can be displayed as three orthogonal
 MRI slices or as a rendering of the head surface. The coordinate system is updated
 according to the definition of the coordinates of these fiducials.

 FIDUCIAL - The coordinate system is updated according to the definition of the
 coordinates of anatomical landmarks or fiducials that are specified in the
 configuration.

 HEADSHAPE - Match the head surface from the MRI with a measured head surface using
 an iterative closest point procedure. The MRI will be updated to match the measured
 head surface. You can optionally do an initial manual coregistration of the two head
 surfaces.

 SPM - Align the individual MRI to the coordinate system of a target or template MRI
 by matching the two volumes.

 FSL - Align the individual MRI to the coordinate system of a target or template MRI
 by matching the two volumes.

 Use as
   [mri] = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri)
 or
   [mri] = ft_volumerealign(cfg, mri, target)
 where the first input is the configuration structure, the second input should be an
 anatomical or functional MRI volume and the third input is the the target anatomical MRI
 for SPM or FSL.

 The configuration can contain the following options
   cfg.method         = string representing the method for aligning
                        'interactive' use the GUI to specify the fiducials
                        'fiducial'    use pre-specified fiducials
                        'headshape'   match the MRI surface to a headshape
                        'spm'         match to template anatomical MRI
                        'fsl'         match to template anatomical MRI
   cfg.coordsys       = string specifying the origin and the axes of the coordinate
                        system. Supported coordinate systems are 'ctf', '4d',
                        'bti', 'yokogawa', 'asa', 'itab', 'neuromag', 'acpc',
                        and 'paxinos'. See http://tinyurl.com/ojkuhqz
   cfg.clim           = [min max], scaling of the anatomy color (default
                        is to adjust to the minimum and maximum)
   cfg.parameter      = 'anatomy' the parameter which is used for the
                         visualization
   cfg.viewresult     = string, 'yes' or 'no', whether or not to visualize aligned volume(s)
                        after realignment (default = 'no')

 When cfg.method = 'fiducial' and a coordinate system that is based on external
 facial anatomical landmarks (common for EEG and MEG), the following is required to
 specify the voxel indices of the fiducials:
   cfg.fiducial.nas    = [i j k], position of nasion
   cfg.fiducial.lpa    = [i j k], position of LPA
   cfg.fiducial.rpa    = [i j k], position of RPA
   cfg.fiducial.zpoint = [i j k], a point on the positive z-axis. This is
                         an optional 'fiducial', and can be used to determine
                         whether the input voxel coordinate axes are left-handed
                         (i.e. flipped in one of the dimensions). If this additional
                         point is specified, and the voxel coordinate axes are left
                         handed, the volume is flipped to yield right handed voxel
                         axes.

 When cfg.method = 'fiducial' and cfg.coordsys = 'acpc', the following
 is required to specify the voxel indices of the fiducials:
   cfg.fiducial.ac      = [i j k], position of anterior commissure
   cfg.fiducial.pc      = [i j k], position of posterior commissure
   cfg.fiducial.xzpoint = [i j k], point on the midsagittal-plane with a
                          positive Z-coordinate, i.e. an interhemispheric
                          point above ac and pc
 The coordinate system will be according to the RAS_Tal convention i.e.
 the origin corresponds with the anterior commissure the Y-axis is along
 the line from the posterior commissure to the anterior commissure the
 Z-axis is towards the vertex, in between the hemispheres the X-axis is
 orthogonal to the YZ-plane, positive to the right

 When cfg.method = 'interactive', a user interface allows for the specification of
 the fiducials or landmarks using the mouse, cursor keys and keyboard.The fiducials
 can be specified by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard (n/l/r or
 a/p/z). When pressing q the interactive mode will stop and the transformation
 matrix is computed. This method supports the following options:
   cfg.viewmode    = 'ortho' or 'surface', visualize the anatomical MRI as three
                      slices or visualize the extracted head surface (default = 'ortho')
   cfg.snapshot     = 'no' ('yes'), making a snapshot of the image once a
                      fiducial or landmark location is selected. The optional second
                      output argument to the function will contain the handles to these
                      figures.
   cfg.snapshotfile = 'ft_volumerealign_snapshot' or string, the root of
                      the filename for the snapshots, including the path. If no path
                      is given the files are saved to the pwd. The consecutive
                      figures will be numbered and saved as png-file.

 When cfg.method = 'headshape', the function extracts the scalp surface from the
 anatomical MRI, and aligns this surface with the user-supplied headshape.
 Additional options pertaining to this method should be defined in the subcfg
 cfg.headshape. The following option is required:
   cfg.headshape.headshape      = string pointing to a file describing a headshape or a
                                  FieldTrip-structure describing a headshape, see FT_READ_HEADSHAPE
 The following options are optional:
   cfg.headshape.scalpsmooth    = scalar, smoothing parameter for the scalp
                                  extraction (default = 2)
   cfg.headshape.scalpthreshold = scalar, threshold parameter for the scalp
                                  extraction (default = 0.1)
   cfg.headshape.interactive    = 'yes' or 'no', use interactive realignment to
                                  align headshape with scalp surface (default =
                                  'yes')
   cfg.headshape.icp            = 'yes' or 'no', use automatic realignment
                                  based on the icp-algorithm. If both 'interactive'
                                  and 'icp' are executed, the icp step follows the
                                  interactive realignment step (default = 'yes')

 When cfg.method is 'fsl', a third input argument is required. The input volume is
 coregistered to this target volume, using FSL-flirt. Additional options pertaining
 to this method should be defined in the sub-structure  cfg.fsl and can include:
   cfg.fsl.path         = string, specifying the path to fsl
   cfg.fsl.costfun      = string, specifying the cost-function used for
                          coregistration
   cfg.fsl.interpmethod = string, specifying the interpolation method, can be
                          'trilinear', 'nearestneighbour', or 'sinc'
   cfg.fsl.dof          = scalar, specifying the number of parameters for the
                          affine transformation. 6 (rigid body), 7 (global
                          rescale), 9 (traditional) or 12.
   cfg.fsl.reslice      = string, specifying whether the output image will be
                          resliced conform the target image (default = 'yes')

 When cfg.method = 'spm', a third input argument is required. The input volume is
 coregistered to this target volume, using SPM. You can specify the version of
 the SPM toolbox to use with
   cfg.spmversion       = string, 'spm2', 'spm8', 'spm12' (default = 'spm8')
 Additional options pertaining to SPM2 and SPM8 should be defined in the
 sub-structure cfg.spm and can include:
   cfg.spm.regtype      = 'subj', 'rigid'
   cfg.spm.smosrc       = scalar value
   cfg.spm.smoref       = scalar value
 Additional options pertaining to SPM12 are
   cfg.spm.sep          = optimisation sampling steps (mm), default: [4 2]
   cfg.spm.params       = starting estimates (6 elements), default: [0 0 0  0 0 0]
   cfg.spm.cost_fun     = cost function string:
                          'mi'  - Mutual Information (default)
                          'nmi' - Normalised Mutual Information
                          'ecc' - Entropy Correlation Coefficient
                          'ncc' - Normalised Cross Correlation
   cfg.spm.tol          = tolerences for accuracy of each param, default: [0.02 0.02 0.02 0.001 0.001 0.001]
   cfg.spm.fwhm         = smoothing to apply to 256x256 joint histogram, default: [7 7]

 With the 'interactive' and 'fiducial' methods it is possible to define an
 additional point (with the key 'z'), which should be a point on the positive side
 of the xy-plane, i.e. with a positive z-coordinate in world coordinates. This point
 will subsequently be used to check whether the input coordinate system is left or
 right-handed. For the 'interactive' method you can also specify an additional
 control point (with the key 'r'), that should be a point with a positive coordinate
 on the left-right axis.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a
 *.mat file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat
 file. These mat files should contain only a single variable,
 corresponding with the input/output structure.
