```
 FT_WIZARD is a graphical user interface to evaluate a FieldTrip analysis
 script one step at a time, allowing you to go to the next step if you are
 content with the data so far, or to the previous step if you want to repeat it
 with different configuration settings.

 Use as
   ft_wizard scriptname
 or 
   ft_wizard('scriptname')

 Use the functional form of FT_WIZARD, such as FT_WIZARD('scriptname'), when
 the name of the script is stored in a string, when an output argument is
 requested, or if the name of the script contains spaces. If you do not
 specify an output argument, the results will be stored as variables in
 the main MATLAB workspace. 
 
 Besides the buttons, you can use the following key combinations
   Ctrl-O        load a new script from a file
   Ctrl-S        save the script to a new file
   Ctrl-E        open the current script in editor
   Ctrl-P        go to previous step
   Ctrl-N        go to next step
   Ctrl-Q        quit, do not save the variables
   Ctrl-X        exit, save the variables to the workspace
