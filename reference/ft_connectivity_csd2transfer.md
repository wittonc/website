 FT_CONNECTIVITY_CSD2TRANSFER computes the transfer-function from frequency domain
 data using the Wilson-Burg algorithm. The transfer function can be used for the
 computation of directional measures of connectivity, such as Granger causality,
 partial directed coherence, or directed transfer functions.

 Use as
   [output] = ft_connectivity_csd2transfer(freq, ...)

 The input variable freq should be a FieldTrip data structure containing frequency
 domain data containing the cross-spectral density computed between all pairs of
 channels, thus containing a 'dimord' of 'chan_chan_freq(_time)'.

 Additional optional input arguments come as key-value pairs:
   numiteration = scalar value (default: 100) the number of iterations
   channelcmb   = Nx2 cell-array listing the channel pairs for the spectral
                    factorization. If not defined or empty (default), a
                    full multivariate factorization is performed, otherwise
                    a multiple pairwise factorization is done.
   tol          = scalar value (default: 1e-18) tolerance limit truncating
                    the iterations
   sfmethod     = 'multivariate', or 'bivariate'
   stabilityfix = false, or true. zigzag-reduction by means of tapering of the
                    intermediate time domain representation when computing the

 The code for the Wilson-Burg algorithm has been very generously provided by Dr.
 Mukesh Dhamala, and Prof. Mingzhou Ding and his group, and has been adjusted for
 efficiency. If you use this code for studying directed interactions, please cite
