 FT_DATATYPE_PARCELLATION describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for parcellated
 cortex-based data and atlases. A parcellation can either be indexed or probabilistic
 (see below).

 A parcellation describes the tissue types for each of the surface elements.
 Parcellations are often, but not always labeled. A parcellatoin can be used to
 estimate the activity from MEG data in a known region of interest. A surface-based
 atlas is basically a very detailled parcellation with an anatomical label for each
 vertex.

 An example of a surface based Brodmann parcellation looks like this

              pos: [8192x3]         positions of the vertices forming the cortical sheet
              tri: [16382x3]        triangles of the cortical sheet
         coordsys: 'ctf'            the (head) coordinate system in which the vertex positions are expressed
             unit: 'mm'             the units in which the coordinate system is expressed
         brodmann: [8192x1 uint8]   values from 1 to N, the value 0 means unknown
    brodmannlabel: {Nx1 cell}

 An alternative representation of this parcellation is

              pos: [8192x3]           positions of the vertices forming the cortical sheet
              tri: [16382x3]          triangles of the cortical sheet
         coordsys: 'ctf'              the (head) coordinate system in which the vertex positions are expressed
             unit: 'mm'               the units in which the coordinate system is expressed
  Brodmann_Area_1: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
  Brodmann_Area_2: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
  Brodmann_Area_3: [8192x1 logical]   binary map representing the voxels belonging to the specific area
  ...

 The examples above demonstrate that a parcellation can be indexed, i.e. consisting of
 subsequent integer numbers (1, 2, ...) or probabilistic, consisting of real numbers
 ranging from 0 to 1 that represent probabilities between 0% and 100%. An extreme case
 is one where the probability is either 0 or 1, in which case the probability can be
 represented as a binary or logical array.

 The only difference to the source data structure is that the parcellation structure
 contains the additional fields xxx and xxxlabel. See FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE for further
 details.

 Revision history:
 (2012/latest) The initial version was defined in accordance with the representation of
 a voxel-based segmentation.
