 FT_DATATYPE_TIMELOCK describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for timelock data

 The timelock data structure represents averaged or non-averaged event-releted
 potentials (ERPs, in case of EEG) or ERFs (in case of MEG). This data structure is
 usually generated with the FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS or FT_TIMELOCKGRANDAVERAGE function.

 An example of a timelock structure containing the ERF for 151 channels MEG data is

     dimord: 'chan_time'       defines how the numeric data should be interpreted
        avg: [151x600 double]  the average values of the activity for 151 channels x 600 timepoints
        var: [151x600 double]  the variance of the activity for 151 channels x 600 timepoints
      label: {151x1 cell}      the channel labels (e.g. 'MRC13')
       time: [1x600 double]    the timepoints in seconds
       grad: [1x1 struct]      information about the sensor array (for EEG data it is called elec)
        cfg: [1x1 struct]      the configuration used by the function that generated this data structure

 Required fields:
   - label, dimord, time

 Optional fields:
   - avg, var, dof, cov, trial, trialinfo, sampleinfo, grad, elec, opto, cfg

 Deprecated fields:
   - <none>

 Obsoleted fields:
   - fsample

 Revision history:

 (2017/latest) The data structure cannot contain an average and simultaneously single
 trial information any more, i.e. avg/var/dof and trial/individual are mutually exclusive.

 (2011v2) The description of the sensors has changed, see FT_DATATYPE_SENS
 for further information.

 (2011) The field 'fsample' was removed, as it was redundant.

 (2003) The initial version was defined.
