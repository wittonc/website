 FT_DATATYPE_HEADMODEL describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for a volume
 conduction model of the head that can be used for forward computations of
 the EEG potentials or the MEG fields. The volume conduction model represents
 the geometrical and the conductive properties of the head. These determine
 how the secondary (or impressed) currents flow and how these contribute to
 the model potential or field.

 A large number of forward solutions for the EEG and MEG are supported
 in FieldTrip, each with its own specification of the MATLAB structure that
 describes the volume conduction model of th ehead. It would be difficult to
 list all the possibilities here. One common feature is that the volume
 conduction model should specify its type, and that preferably it should
 specify the geometrical units in which it is expressed (e.g. mm, cm or m).

 An example of an EEG volume conduction model with 4 concentric spheres is:

 headmodel =
        r: [86 88 94 100]
        c: [0.33 1.00 0.042 0.33]
        o: [0 0 0]
     type: 'concentricspheres'
     unit: 'mm'

 An example of an MEG volume conduction model with a single sphere fitted to
 the scalp with its center 4 cm above the line connecting the ears is:

 headmodel =
        r: [12]
        o: [0 0 4]
     type: 'singlesphere'
     unit: 'cm'

 For each of the methods XXX for the volume conduction model, a corresponding
 function FT_HEADMODEL_XXX exists that contains all specific details and
 references to literature that describes the implementation.

 Required fields:
   - type

 Optional fields:
   - unit

 Deprecated fields:
   - inner_skull_surface, source_surface, skin_surface, source, skin

 Obsoleted fields:
   - <none specified>

 Revision history:

 (2015/latest) Use the field name "pos" instead of "pnt" for vertex positions.

 (2014) All numeric values are represented in double precision.

 (2013) Always use the field "cond" for conductivity.

 (2012) Use consistent names for the volume conductor type in the structure, the
 documentation and for the actual implementation, e.g. bem_openmeeg -> openmeeg,
 fem_simbio -> simbio, concentric -> concentricspheres. Deprecated the fields
 that indicate the index of the innermost and outermost surfaces.
