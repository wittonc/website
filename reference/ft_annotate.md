```
 FT_ANNOTATE returns the same output data as the user has provided as input, but allows
 to add comments to that data structure. These comments are stored along with the other
 provenance information and can be displayed with FT_ANALYSISPIPELINE. Adding comments
 is especially useful if you have manually (i.e. in plain MATLAB) modified the data
 structure, whereby some provenance information is missing.

 Use as
   outdata = ft_examplefunction(cfg, indata)
 where the input data structure can be any of the FieldTrip data structures and
 the configuration structure should contain
   cfg.comment    = string

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
