 FT_SCALPCURRENTDENSITY computes an estimate of the SCD using the
 second-order derivative (the surface Laplacian) of the EEG potential
 distribution

 The relation between the surface Laplacian and the SCD is explained
 in more detail on http://tinyurl.com/ptovowl.

 Use as
   [data] = ft_scalpcurrentdensity(cfg, data)
 or
   [timelock] = ft_scalpcurrentdensity(cfg, timelock)
 where the input data is obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING or from
 FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS. The output data has the same format as the input
 and can be used in combination with most other FieldTrip functions
 such as FT_FREQNALYSIS or FT_TOPOPLOTER.

 The configuration should contain
   cfg.method       = 'finite' for finite-difference method or
                      'spline' for spherical spline method
                      'hjorth' for Hjorth approximation method
   cfg.elec         = structure with electrode positions or filename, see FT_READ_SENS
   cfg.trials       = 'all' or a selection given as a 1xN vector (default = 'all')
   cfg.feedback     = string, 'no', 'text', 'textbar', 'gui' (default = 'text')

 The finite method require the following
   cfg.conductivity = conductivity of the skin (default = 0.33 S/m)

 The spline and finite method require the following
   cfg.conductivity = conductivity of the skin (default = 0.33 S/m)
   cfg.lambda       = regularization parameter (default = 1e-05)
   cfg.order        = order of the splines (default = 4)
   cfg.degree       = degree of legendre polynomials (default for
                       <=32 electrodes  = 9,
                       <=64 electrodes  = 14,
                       <=128 electrodes = 20,
                       else             = 32

 The hjorth method requires the following
   cfg.neighbours   = neighbourhood structure, see FT_PREPARE_NEIGHBOURS

 For the spline method you can specify the following
   cfg.badchannel      = cell-array, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details (default = [])

 Note that the skin conductivity, electrode dimensions and the potential
 all have to be expressed in the same SI units, otherwise the units of
 the SCD values are not scaled correctly. The spatial distribution still
 will be correct.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
