```
 FT_PREPARE_HEADMODEL constructs a volume conduction model from the geometry
 of the head. The volume conduction model specifies how currents that are
 generated by sources in the brain, e.g. dipoles, are propagated through the
 tissue and how these result in externally measureable EEG potentials or MEG
 fields.

 FieldTrip implements a variety of forward solutions, partially with internal
 code and some of them using external toolboxes or executables. Each of the
 forward solutions requires a set of configuration options which are listed
 below. This function takes care of all the preparatory steps in the
 construction of the volume conduction model and sets it up so that
 subsequent computations are efficient and fast.

 Use as
   headmodel = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg)               or
   headmodel = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, mesh)         with the output of FT_PREPARE_MESH or FT_READ_HEADSHAPE
   headmodel = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, seg)          with the output of FT_VOLUMESEGMENT
   headmodel = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, elec)         with the output of FT_READ_SENS
   headmodel = ft_prepare_headmodel(cfg, sourcemodel)  with the output of FT_PREPARE_LEADFIELD

 In general the input to this function is a geometrical description of the
 shape of the head and a description of the electrical conductivity. The
 geometrical description can be a set of surface points obtained from
 fT_READ_HEADSHAPE, a surface mesh that was obtained from FT_PREPARE_MESH or
 a segmented anatomical MRI that was obtained from FT_VOLUMESEGMENT.

 The cfg argument is a structure that can contain:
   cfg.method         string that specifies the forward solution, see below
   cfg.conductivity   a number or a vector containing the conductivities of the compartments
   cfg.tissue         a string or integer, to be used in combination with a 'seg' for the
                      second intput. If 'brain', 'skull', and 'scalp' are fields
                      present in 'seg', then cfg.tissue need not be specified, as
                      these are defaults, depending on cfg.method. Otherwise,
                      cfg.tissue should refer to which field(s) of seg should be used.
