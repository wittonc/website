 FT_HEADMODELTYPE determines the type of volume conduction model of the head

 Use as
   [type] = ft_headmodeltype(headmodel)
 to get a string describing the type, or
   [flag] = ft_headmodeltype(headmodel, desired)
 to get a boolean value.

 For EEG the following volume conduction models are recognized
   singlesphere       analytical single sphere model
   concentricspheres  analytical concentric sphere model with up to 4 spheres
   halfspace          infinite homogenous medium on one side, vacuum on the other
   openmeeg           boundary element method, based on the OpenMEEG software
   bemcp              boundary element method, based on the implementation from Christophe Phillips
   dipoli             boundary element method, based on the implementation from Thom Oostendorp
   asa                boundary element method, based on the (commercial) ASA software
   simbio             finite element method, based on the SimBio software
   fns                finite difference method, based on the FNS software
   interpolate        interpolate the potential based on pre-computed leadfields

 and for MEG the following volume conduction models are recognized
   singlesphere       analytical single sphere model
   localspheres       local spheres model for MEG, one sphere per channel
   singleshell        realisically shaped single shell approximation, based on the implementation from Guido Nolte
   infinite           magnetic dipole in an infinite vacuum
   interpolate        interpolate the potential based on pre-computed leadfields
