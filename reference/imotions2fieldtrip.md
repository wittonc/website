```
 IMOTIONS2FIELDTRIP imports an iMotions *.txt file and represents it as a FieldTrip
 raw data structure.

 Use as
   data = imotions2fieldtrip(filename, ...)

 Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
   interpolate   = 'no', 'time' or 'data' (default = 'no')
   isnumeric     = cell-array with labels corresponding to numeric data (default = {})
   isinteger     = cell-array with labels corresponding to integer data that should be interpolated with nearest where applicable (default = {})
   isnotnumeric  = cell-array with labels not corresponding to numeric data (default = {})
   isevent       = cell-array with labels corresponding to events (default = {})
   isnotevent    = cell-array with labels not corresponding to events (default = {})

 The options 'isnumeric' and 'isnotnumeric' are mutually exclusive. Idem for
 'isevent' and 'isnotevent'.

 When using the interpolate='data' option, both the data and the time are interpolated
 to a regularly sampled representation, when using the interpolate='time' option, only
 the time axis is interpolated to a regularly sampled representation.  This addresses
 the case that the data was actually acquired with a regular sampling rate, but the time
 stamps in the file are not correctly representing this (a known bug with some type of
 iMotions data).
