```
 FT_READ_CIFTI read functional data or functional connectivity from a cifti-1 or
 cifti-2 file. The functional data can consist of a dense or a parcellated
 representation. The geometrical description of the brainordinates can consist of
 triangulated surfaces or voxels in a regular 3-D volumetric grid. If available,
 it also reads the geometrical description of the surfaces from the accompanying
 gifti files.

 Use as
   data = ft_read_cifti(filename, ...)

 If the file contains a dense representation of functional data, the output data
 structure is organized according to the FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE or FT_DATATYPE_VOLUME
 definition.

 If the contains a parcellated representation of functional data, the output data
 structure is organized according to the FT_DATATYPE_TIMELOCK or FT_DATATYPE_FREQ
 definition. In addition, the description of the geometry wil be represented in a
 data.brainordinate field, which is organized according to the FT_DATATYPE_SOURCE
 or FT_DATATYPE_VOLUME definition.

 Any optional input arguments should come in key-value pairs and may include
   'readdata'         = boolean, can be false or true (default depends on file size)
   'readsurface'      = boolean, can be false or true (default = true)
   'cortexleft'       = string, filename with left cortex (optional, default is automatic)
   'cortexright'      = string, filename with right cortex (optional, default is automatic)
   'hemisphereoffset' = number, amount in milimeter to move the hemispheres apart from each other (default = 0)
   'mapname'          = string, 'field' to represent multiple maps separately, or 'array' to represent as array (default = 'field')
   'debug'            = boolean, write a debug.xml file (default = false)
