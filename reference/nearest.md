title: nearest
---
```
 NEAREST return the index of an array nearest to a scalar

 Use as
   [indx] = nearest(array, val, insideflag, toleranceflag)

 The second input val can be a scalar, or a [minval maxval] vector for
 limits selection.

 If not specified or if left empty, the insideflag and the toleranceflag
 will default to false.

 The boolean insideflag can be used to specify whether the value should be
 within the array or not. For example nearest(1:10, -inf) will return 1,
 but nearest(1:10, -inf, true) will return an error because -inf is not
 within the array.

 The boolean toleranceflag is used when insideflag is true. It can be used
 to specify whether some tolerance should be allowed for values that are
 just outside the array. For example nearest(1:10, 0.99, true, false) will
 return an error, but nearest(1:10, 0.99, true, true) will return 1. The
 tolerance that is allowed is half the distance between the subsequent
 values in the array.
