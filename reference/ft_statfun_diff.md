title: ft_statfun_diff

```
 FT_STATFUN_DIFF computes the difference of the mean in two conditions. Although it
 can be used for statistical testing, it is not very usefull since it will have
 rather limited sensitivity.
 
 The purpose of this function is to show you an example on how to write a statfun
 that expresses the difference in the data between two conditions. You can use such
 a function with the statistical framework in FieldTrip to perform a simple (or more
 complex) permutation test, without having to worry about the representation of the
 data.

 See also FT_STATFUN_MEAN for another example function
