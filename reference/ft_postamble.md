title: ft_postamble

```
 FT_POSTAMBLE is a helper function that is included in many of the FieldTrip
 functions and which takes care of some general settings and operations at the end
 of the function.

 This ft_postamble m-file is a function, but internally it executes a number of
 private scripts in the callers workspace. This allows the private script to access
 the variables in the callers workspace and behave as if the script were included as
 a header file in C-code.
