```
 FT_APPENDDATA concatenates multiple raw data structures that have been preprocessed
 separately into a single raw data structure.

 Use as
   data = ft_appenddata(cfg, data1, data2, data3, ...)

 The following configuration options are supported:
   cfg.keepsampleinfo  = 'yes', 'no', 'ifmakessense' (default = 'ifmakessense')

 If the input datasets all have the same channels, the trials will be concatenated.
 This is useful for example if you have different experimental conditions, which,
 besides analyzing them separately, for some reason you also want to analyze
 together. The function will check for consistency in the order of the channels. If
 the order is inconsistent the channel order of the output will be according to the
 channel order of the first data structure in the input.

 If the input datasets have different channels, but the same number of trials, the
 channels will be concatenated within each trial. This is useful for example if the
 data that you want to analyze contains both MEG and EMG channels which require
 different preprocessing options.

 If you concatenate trials and the data originates from the same original datafile,
 the sampleinfo is consistent and you can specify cfg.keepsampleinfo='yes'. If the
 data originates from different datafiles, the sampleinfo is inconsistent and does
 not point to the same recording, hence you should specify cfg.keepsampleinfo='no'.

 Occasionally, the data needs to be concatenated in the trial dimension while
 there's a slight discrepancy in the channels in the input data (e.g. missing
 channels in one of the data structures). The function will then return a data
 structure containing only the channels which are present in all inputs.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure. The data structure in the input file should be a
 cell-array for this particular function.
