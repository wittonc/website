 FT_ANONYMIZEDATA clears the value of potentially identifying fields in
 the data and in the provenance information, i.e., it updates the data and
 the configuration structure and history that is maintained by FieldTrip
 in the cfg field.

 Use as
   output = ft_anonymizedata(cfg, data)
 where data is any FieldTrip data structure and cfg is a configuration
 structure that should contain
   cfg.keepnumeric = 'yes' or 'no', keep numeric fields (default = 'yes')
   cfg.keepfield   = cell-array with strings, fields to keep (default = {})
   cfg.removefield = cell-array with strings, fields to remove (default = {})
   cfg.keepvalue   = cell-array with strings, values to keep (default = {})
   cfg.removevalue = cell-array with strings, values to remove (default = {})

 The graphical user interface consists of a table that shows the name and
 value of each provenance element, and whether it should be kept or
 removed. Furthermore, it has a number of buttons:
   - sort        specify which column is used for sorting
   - apply       apply the current selection of 'keep' and 'remove' and hide the corresponding rows
   - keep all    toggle all visibe rows to 'keep'
   - remove all  toggle all visibe rows to 'keep'
   - clear all   clear all visibe rows, i.e. neither 'keep' nor 'remove'
   - quit        apply the current selection of 'keep' and 'remove' and exit

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile  = ...
   cfg.outputfile  = ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
