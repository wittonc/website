```
 FT_STRATIFY tries to reduce the variance in a specific feature in the data
 that is not related to an effect in two or multiple conditions, but where
 that feature may confound the analysis. Stratification is implemented by
 randomly removing elements from the data, making the distribution of the
 data equal on that feature.

 Use as
   [output]          = ft_stratify(cfg, input1, input2, ...), or
   [output, binaxis] = ft_stratify(cfg, input1, input2, ...)

 For the histogram and the split method, each input is a Nchan X Nobs
 matrix. The output is a cell-array with in each cell the same data as in
 the corresponding input, except that the observations that should be
 removed are marked with a NaN.

 For the equatespike method, each input is a Ntrials X 1 cell-array. Each
 trial should contain the spike firing moments (i.e. a logical Nchans X
 Nsamples matrix). The output is a cell-array with in each cell the same
 data as in the corresponding input, except that spike numbers have been
 equated in each trial and channel.

 The configuration should contain
   cfg.method      = 'histogram'
                     'splithilo'
                     'splitlohi'
                     'splitlolo'
                     'splithihi'
                     'equatespike'

 The following options apply only to histogram and split methods.
   cfg.equalbinavg = 'yes'
   cfg.numbin      = 10
   cfg.numiter     = 2000

 The following options apply only to the equatespike method.
   cfg.pairtrials  = 'spikesort', 'linkage' or 'no' (default = 'spikesort')
   cfg.channel     = 'all' or list with indices ( default = 'all')
