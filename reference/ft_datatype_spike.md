 FT_DATATYPE_SPIKE describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for spike data

 Spike data is obtained using FT_READ_SPIKE to read files from a Plexon,
 Neuralynx or other animal electrophysiology data acquisition system. It
 is characterised as a sparse point-process, i.e. each neuronal firing is
 only represented as the time at which the firing happened. Optionally,
 the spike waveform can also be represented. Using this waveform, the
 neuronal firing events can be sorted into their single units.

 A required characteristic of the SPIKE structure is a cell-array with the
 label of the (single or multi) units.

         label: {'unit1'  'unit2'  'unit3'}

 The fields of the SPIKE structure that contain the specific information
 per spike depends on the available information. A relevant distinction
 can be made between the representation of raw spikes that are not related
 to the temporal structure of the experimental design (i.e trials), and
 the data representation in which the spikes are related to the trial.

 For a continuous recording the SPIKE structure must contain a cell-array
 with the raw timestamps as recorded by the hardware system. As example,
 the original content of the .timestamp field can be

         timestamp:  {[1x504 uint64]  [1x50 uint64]  [1x101 uint64]}

 An optional field that is typically obtained from the raw recording
 contains the waveforms for every unit and label as a cell-array. For
 example, the content of this field may be

         waveform:   {[1x32x504 double] [1x32x50 double] [1x32x101 double]}

 If the data has been organised to reflect the temporal structure of the
 experiment (i.e. the trials), the SPIKE structure should contain a
 cell-array with the spike times relative to an experimental trigger. The
 FT_SPIKE_MAKETRIALS function can be used to reorganise the SPIKE
 structure such that the spike times are expressed relative to a trigger
 instead of relative to the acquisition devices internal timestamp clock.
 The time field then contains only those spikes that ocurred within one of
 the trials . The spike times are now expressed on seconds relative to the
 trigger.

         time:       {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}

 In addition, for every spike we register in which trial the spike was
 recorded:

         trial:      {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}

 To fully reconstruct the structure of the spike-train, it is required
 that the exact start- and end-point of the trial (in seconds) is
 represented. This is specified in a nTrials x 2 matrix.

         trialtime:  [100x2 double]

 As an example, FT_SPIKE_MAKETRIALS could result in the following
 SPIKE structure that represents the spikes of three units that were
 observed in 100 trials:

         label:           {'unit1'  'unit2'  'unit3'}
         timestamp:       {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         time:            {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         trial:           {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         trialtime:       [100x2 double]
         sampleinfo:      [100x2 double]
         waveform:        {[1x32x504 double] [1x32x50 double] [1x32x101 double]}
         waveformdimord: '{chan}_lead_time_spike'
         cfg

 For analysing the relation between the spikes and the local field
 potential (e.g. phase-locking), the SPIKE structure can have additional
 fields such as fourierspctrm, lfplabel, freq and fourierspctrmdimord.

 For example, from the structure above we may obtain

         label:          {'unit1'  'unit2'  'unit3'}
         timestamp:      {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         time:           {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         trial:          {[1x504 double] [1x50 double] [1x101 double]}
         trialtime:      [100x2 double]
         waveform:       {[1x32x504 double] [1x32x50 double] [1x32x101 double]}
         waveformdimord: '{chan}_lead_time_spike'
         fourierspctrm:  {504x2x20, 50x2x20, 101x2x20}
         fourierspctrmdimord: '{chan}_spike_lfplabel_freq'
         lfplabel:       {'lfpchan1', 'lfpchan2'}
         freq:           [1x20 double]

 Revision history:

 (2012) Changed the dimensionality of the waveform to allow both
 stereotrode and tetrode data to be represented.
 
 (2011/latest) Defined a consistent spike data representation that can
 also contain the Fourier spectrum and other fields. Use the xxxdimord
 to indicate the dimensions of the field.

 (2010) Introduced the time and the trialtime fields.

 (2007) Introduced the spike data representation.
