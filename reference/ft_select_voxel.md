title: ft_select_voxel

```
 FT_SELECT_VOXEL is a helper function that can be used as callback function
 in a figure. It allows the user to select a voxel from a (resliced) 3-D volume.

 Use as
   voxel = ft_select_voxel(h, eventdata, ...)
 The first two arguments are automatically passed by MATLAB to any
 callback function.

 Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
   'callback'  = function handle to be executed after channels have been selected

 You can pass additional arguments to the callback function in a cell-array
 like {@function_handle,arg1,arg2}

 Example
   % create a figure with a random 3-D volume
   mri = rand(128,128,128);
   ft_plot_slice(mri, 'location', [64 64 64], 'orientation', [1 1 1]);
   view(120,30)
   xlabel('x'); ylabel('y'); zlabel('z'); grid on
   axis([0 128 0 128 0 128])
   axis equal; axis vis3d
   axis([0 128 0 128 0 128])

   % add this function as the callback to make a single selection
   set(gcf, 'WindowButtonDownFcn', {@ft_select_voxel, 'callback', @disp})

 Subsequently you can click in the figure and you'll see that the disp
 function is executed as callback and that it displays the selected
 voxel.
