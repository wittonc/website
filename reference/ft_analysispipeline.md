 FT_ANALYSIPIPELINE reconstructs the complete analysis pipeline that was used to create
 the input FieldTrip data structure. The pipeline will be visualized as a flowchart.
 In the future it will be possible to output the complete pipeline as a MATLAB script
 or in a specialized pipeline format (e.g. PSOM, JIST, LONI, Taverna).

 Use as
   output = ft_analysispipeline(cfg, data)

 The first cfg input contains the settings that apply to the behavior of this
 particular function and the second data input argument can be the output of any
 FieldTrip function, e.g. FT_PREPROCESSING, FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS, FT_SOURCEANALYSIS,
 FT_FREQSTATISTICS or whatever you like.

 Alternatively, for the second input argument you can also only give the configuration
 of the processed data (i.e. "data.cfg") instead of the full data.

 The configuration options that apply to the behavior of this function are
   cfg.filename   = string, filename without the extension
   cfg.filetype   = string, can be 'matlab', 'html' or 'dot'
   cfg.feedback   = string, 'no', 'text', 'gui' or 'yes', whether text and/or
                    graphical feedback should be presented (default = 'yes')
   cfg.showinfo   = string or cell-array of strings, information to display
                    in the gui boxes, can be any combination of
                    'functionname', 'revision', 'matlabversion',
                    'computername', 'username', 'calltime', 'timeused',
                    'memused', 'workingdir', 'scriptpath' (default =
                    'functionname', only display function name). Can also
                    be 'all', show all pipeline. Please note that if you want
                    to show a lot of information, this will require a lot
                    of screen real estate.
   cfg.remove     = cell-array with strings, determines which objects will
                    be removed from the configuration prior to writing it to
                    file. For readibility of the script, you may want to
                    remove the large objectssuch as event structure, trial
                    definition, source positions
  cfg.keepremoved = 'yes' or 'no', determines whether removed fields are
                    completely removed, or only replaced by a short textual
                    description (default = 'no')

 This function uses the nested cfg and cfg.previous that are present in
 the data structure. It will use the configuration and the nested previous
 configurations to climb all the way back into the tree. This funtction
 will print a complete MATLAB script to screen (and optionally to file).
 Furthermore, it will show an interactive graphical flowchart
 representation of the steps taken during the pipeline(i). In the flowchart
 you can click on one of the steps to see the configuration details of
 that pipeline(i).

 Note that the nested cfg and cfg.previous in your data might not contain
 all details that are required to reconstruct a complete and valid
 analysis script.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 If you specify this, the input data will be read from a *.mat file on disk. The
 file should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the input structure.
