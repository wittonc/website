 FT_SOURCEANALYSIS performs beamformer dipole analysis on EEG or MEG data
 after preprocessing and a timelocked or frequency analysis

 Use as
   [source] = ft_sourceanalysis(cfg, freq)
 or
   [source] = ft_sourceanalysis(cfg, timelock)

 where the second input argument with the data should be organised in a structure
 as obtained from the FT_FREQANALYSIS or FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS function. The
 configuration "cfg" is a structure containing information about source positions
 and other options.

 The different source reconstruction algorithms that are implemented are
   cfg.method     = 'lcmv'    linear constrained minimum variance beamformer
                    'sam'     synthetic aperture magnetometry
                    'dics'    dynamic imaging of coherent sources
                    'pcc'     partial cannonical correlation/coherence
                    'mne'     minimum norm estimation
                    'rv'      scan residual variance with single dipole
                    'music'   multiple signal classification
                    'sloreta' standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography
                    'eloreta' exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography
 The DICS and PCC methods are for frequency or time-frequency domain data, all other
 methods are for time domain data. ELORETA can be used both for time, frequency and
 time-frequency domain data.

 The complete grid with dipole positions and optionally precomputed leadfields is
 constructed using FT_PREPARE_SOURCEMODEL. It can be specified as as a regular 3-D
 grid that is aligned with the axes of the head coordinate system using
   cfg.xgrid               = vector (e.g. -20:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.ygrid               = vector (e.g. -20:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.zgrid               = vector (e.g.   0:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.resolution          = number (e.g. 1 cm) for automatic grid generation
 If the source model destribes a triangulated cortical sheet, it is described as
   cfg.sourcemodel.pos     = N*3 matrix with the vertex positions of the cortical sheet
   cfg.sourcemodel.tri     = M*3 matrix that describes the triangles connecting the vertices
 Alternatively the position of a few dipoles at locations of interest can be
 user-specified, for example obtained from an anatomical or functional MRI
   cfg.sourcemodel.pos     = N*3 matrix with position of each source
   cfg.sourcemodel.inside  = N*1 vector with boolean value whether grid point is inside brain (optional)
   cfg.sourcemodel.dim     = [Nx Ny Nz] vector with dimensions in case of 3-D grid (optional)

 Besides the source positions, you may also include previously computed
 spatial filters and/or leadfields using
   cfg.sourcemodel.filter
   cfg.sourcemodel.leadfield

 The following strategies are supported to obtain statistics for the source parameters using
 multiple trials in the data, either directly or through a resampling-based approach
   cfg.rawtrial      = 'no' or 'yes'   construct filter from single trials, apply to single trials. Note that you also may want to set cfg.keeptrials='yes' to keep all trial information, especially if using in combination with sourcemodel.filter
   cfg.jackknife     = 'no' or 'yes'   jackknife resampling of trials
   cfg.pseudovalue   = 'no' or 'yes'   pseudovalue resampling of trials
   cfg.bootstrap     = 'no' or 'yes'   bootstrap resampling of trials
   cfg.numbootstrap  = number of bootstrap replications (e.g. number of original trials)
 If none of these options is specified, the average over the trials will
 be computed prior to computing the source reconstruction.

 To obtain statistics over the source parameters between two conditions, you
 can also use a resampling procedure that reshuffles the trials over both
 conditions. In that case, you should call the function with two datasets
 containing single trial data like
   [source] = ft_sourceanalysis(cfg, freqA, freqB)
   [source] = ft_sourceanalysis(cfg, timelockA, timelockB)
 and you should specify
   cfg.randomization      = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.permutation        = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.numrandomization   = number, e.g. 500
   cfg.numpermutation     = number, e.g. 500 or 'all'

 If you have not specified a sourcemodel with pre-computed leadfields,
 the leadfield for each source position will be computed on the fly.
 In that case you can modify the leadfields by reducing the rank
 (i.e.  remove the weakest orientation), or by normalizing each
 column.
   cfg.reducerank  = 'no', or number (default = 3 for EEG, 2 for MEG)
   cfg.normalize   = 'no' or 'yes' (default = 'no')

 Other configuration options are
   cfg.channel       = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
                       see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.frequency     = single number (in Hz)
   cfg.latency       = single number in seconds, for time-frequency analysis
   cfg.lambda        = number or empty for automatic default
   cfg.kappa         = number or empty for automatic default
   cfg.tol           = number or empty for automatic default
   cfg.refchan       = reference channel label (for coherence)
   cfg.refdip        = reference dipole location (for coherence)
   cfg.supchan       = suppressed channel label(s)
   cfg.supdip        = suppressed dipole location(s)
   cfg.keeptrials    = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.keepleadfield = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.projectnoise  = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.keepfilter    = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.keepcsd       = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.keepmom       = 'no' or 'yes'
   cfg.feedback      = 'no', 'text', 'textbar', 'gui' (default = 'text')

 The volume conduction model of the head should be specified as
   cfg.headmodel     = structure with volume conduction model, see FT_PREPARE_HEADMODEL

 The EEG or MEG sensor positions can be present in the data or can be specified as
   cfg.elec          = structure with electrode positions or filename, see FT_READ_SENS
   cfg.grad          = structure with gradiometer definition or filename, see FT_READ_SENS

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
