 FT_CONNECTIVITYSIMULATION simulates channel-level time-series data with a
 specified connectivity structure. This function returns an output data
 structure that resembles the output of FT_PREPROCESSING.

 Use as
   [data] = ft_connectivitysimulation(cfg)
 where the configuration structure should contain:
   cfg.method      = string, can be 'linear_mix', 'mvnrnd', 'ar', 'ar_reverse' (see below)
   cfg.nsignal     = scalar, number of signals
   cfg.ntrials     = scalar, number of trials
   cfg.triallength = in seconds
   cfg.fsample     = in Hz

 Method 'linear_mix' implements a linear mixing with optional time shifts
 where the number of unobserved signals can be different from the number
 of observed signals

 Required configuration options:
   cfg.mix    = matrix, [nsignal x number of unobserved signals]
                specifying the mixing from the unobserved signals to
                the observed signals, or
              = matrix, [nsignal x number of unobserved signals x number of
                samples] specifying the mixing from the
                unobserved signals to the observed signals which
                changes as a function of time within the trial
              = cell-arry, [1 x ntrials] with each cell a matrix as
                specified above, when a trial-specific mixing is
                required
   cfg.delay  = matrix, [nsignal x number of unobserved signals]
                specifying the time shift (in samples) between the
                unobserved signals and the observed signals

 Optional configuration options:
   cfg.bpfilter  = 'yes' (or 'no')
   cfg.bpfreq    = [bplow bphigh] (default: [15 25])
   cfg.demean    = 'yes' (or 'no')
   cfg.baselinewindow = [begin end] in seconds, the default is the complete trial
   cfg.absnoise  = scalar (default: 1), specifying the standard deviation of
                   white noise superimposed on top of the simulated signals
   cfg.randomseed = 'yes' or a number or vector with the seed value (default = 'yes')

 Method 'mvnrnd' implements a linear mixing with optional timeshifts in
 where the number of unobserved signals is equal to the number of observed
 signals. This method used the MATLAB function mvnrnd. The implementation
 is a bit ad-hoc and experimental, so users are discouraged to apply it.
 The time shift occurs only after the linear mixing, so the effect of the
 parameters on the simulation is not really clear. This method will be
 disabled in the future.

 Required configuration options:
   cfg.covmat    = covariance matrix between the signals
   cfg.delay     = delay vector between the signals in samples

 Optional configuration options:
   cfg.bpfilter  = 'yes' (or 'no')
   cfg.bpfreq    = [bplow bphigh] (default: [15 25])
   cfg.demean    = 'yes' (or 'no')
   cfg.baselinewindow = [begin end] in seconds, the default is the complete trial
   cfg.absnoise  = scalar (default: 1), specifying the standard
                   deviation of white noise superimposed on top
                   of the simulated signals

 Method 'ar' implements a multivariate autoregressive model to generate
 the data.

 Required cfg options:
   cfg.params   = matrix, [nsignal x nsignal x number of lags] specifying the
                  autoregressive coefficient parameters. A non-zero
                  element at cfg.params(i,j,k) means a
                  directional influence from signal j onto
                  signal i (at lag k).
   cfg.noisecov = matrix, [nsignal x nsignal] specifying the covariance
                  matrix of the innovation process

 Method 'ar_reverse' implements a multivariate autoregressive
 autoregressive model to generate the data, where the model coefficients
 are reverse-computed, based on the interaction pattern specified.

 Required cfg options:
   cfg.coupling = nxn matrix, specifying coupling strength, rows causing
                   column
   cfg.delay    = nxn matrix, specifying the delay, in seconds, from one
                   signal's spectral component to the other signal, rows
                   causing column
   cfg.ampl     = nxn matrix, specifying the amplitude
   cfg.bpfreq   = nxnx2 matrix, specifying the lower and upper frequencies
                   of the bands that are transmitted, rows causing column

 The generated signals will have a spectrum that is 1/f + additional
 band-limited components, as specified in the cfg.
