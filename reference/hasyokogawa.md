 HASYOKOGAWA tests whether the data input toolbox for MEG systems by
 Yokogawa (www.yokogawa.com, designed by KIT/EagleTechnology) is
 installed. Only the newest version of the toolbox is accepted.

 Use as
   string  = hasyokogawa;
 which returns a string describing the toolbox version, e.g. "12bitBeta3",
 "16bitBeta3", or "16bitBeta6" for preliminary versions, or '1.5' for the
 official Yokogawa MEG Reader Toolbox. An empty string is returned if the toolbox
 is not installed. The string "unknown" is returned if it is installed but
 the version is unknown.

 Alternatively you can use it as
   [boolean] = hasyokogawa(desired);
 where desired is a string with the desired version.
