```
 FT_REMOVETEMPLATEARTIFACT removes an artifact from preprocessed data by template
 subtraction. The template can for example be formed by averaging an ECG-triggered
 MEG timecourse.

 Use as
   dataclean = ft_removetemplateartifact(cfg, data, template)
 where data is raw data as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING and template is a averaged
 timelock structure as obtained from FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS. The configuration should
 be according to

   cfg.channel  = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'), see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.artifact = Mx2 matrix with sample numbers of the artifact segments, e.g. obtained from FT_ARTIFACT_EOG

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
