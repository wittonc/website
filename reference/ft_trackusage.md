```
 FT_TRACKUSAGE tracks the usage of specific FieldTrip components using a central
 tracking server. This involves sending a small snippet of information to the
 server. Tracking is only used to gather data on the usage of the FieldTrip
 toolbox, to get information on the number of users and on the frequency of use
 of specific toolbox functions. This allows the toolbox developers to improve the
 FIeldTrip toolbox source code, documentation and to provide better support.

 This function will NOT upload any information about the data, nor about the
 configuration that you are using in your analyses.

 This function will NOT upload any identifying details about you. Your username
 and computer name are "salted" and subsequently converted with the MD5
 cryptographic hashing function into a unique identifier. Not knowing the salt,
 it is impossible to decode these MD5 hashes and recover the original
 identifiers.

 It is possible to disable the tracking for all functions by specifying
 the following
   global ft_defaults
   ft_default.trackusage = 'no'
