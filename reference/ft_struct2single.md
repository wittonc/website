title: ft_struct2single
---
```
 FT_STRUCT2SINGLE converts all double precision numeric data in a structure
 into single precision, which takes up half the amount of memory compared
 to double precision. It will also convert plain matrices and cell-arrays.

 Use as
   x = ft_struct2single(x)

 Starting from MATLAB 7.0, you can use single precision data in your
 computations, i.e. you do not have to convert back to double precision.

 MATLAB version 6.5 and older only support single precision for storing
 data in memory or on disk, but do not allow computations on single
 precision data. After reading a single precision structure from file, you
 can convert it back with FT_STRUCT2DOUBLE.
