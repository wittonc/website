title: ft_chantype

```
 FT_CHANTYPE determines for each individual channel what chantype of data it
 represents, e.g. a planar gradiometer, axial gradiometer, magnetometer,
 trigger channel, etc. If you want to know what the acquisition system is
 (e.g. ctf151 or neuromag306), you should not use this function but
 FT_SENSTYPE instead.

 Use as
   type = ft_chantype(hdr)
   type = ft_chantype(sens)
   type = ft_chantype(label)
 or as
   type = ft_chantype(hdr,   desired)
   type = ft_chantype(sens,  desired)
   type = ft_chantype(label, desired)

 If the desired unit is not specified as second input argument, this
 function returns a Nchan*1 cell-array with a string describing the type
 of each channel.

 If the desired unit is specified as second input argument, this function
 returns a Nchan*1 boolean vector with "true" for the channels of the
 desired type and "false" for the ones that do not match.

 The specification of the channel types depends on the acquisition system,
 for example the ctf275 system includes the following type of channels:
 meggrad, refmag, refgrad, adc, trigger, eeg, headloc, headloc_gof.
