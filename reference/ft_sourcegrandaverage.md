 FT_SOURCEGRANDAVERAGE averages source reconstructions over either multiple
 subjects or conditions. It computes the average and variance for all
 known source parameters. The output can be used in FT_SOURCESTATISTICS
 with the method 'parametric'.

 Alternatively, it can construct an average for multiple input source
 reconstructions in two conditions after randomly reassigning the
 input data over the two conditions. The output then can be used in
 FT_SOURCESTATISTICS with the method 'randomization' or 'randcluster'.

 The input source structures should be spatially alligned to each other
 and should have the same positions for the sourcemodel.

 Use as
  [grandavg] = ft_sourcegrandaverage(cfg, source1, source2, ...)

 where the source structures are obtained from FT_SOURCEANALYSIS or
 from FT_VOLUMENORMALISE, and the configuration can contain the
 following fields:
   cfg.parameter          = string, describing the functional data to be processed, e.g. 'pow', 'nai' or 'coh'
   cfg.keepindividual     = 'no' or 'yes'

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure. For this particular function, the input data
 should be structured as a single cell-array.
