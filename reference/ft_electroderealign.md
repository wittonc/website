```
 FT_ELECTRODEREALIGN rotates, translates, scales and warps electrode positions. The
 default is to only rotate and translate, i.e. to do a rigid body transformation in
 which only the coordinate system is changed. With the right settings if can apply
 additional deformations to the input sensors (e.g. scale them to better fit the
 skin surface). The different methods are described in detail below.

 INTERACTIVE - You can display the skin surface together with the electrode or
 gradiometer positions, and manually (using the graphical user interface) adjust the
 rotation, translation and scaling parameters, so that the electrodes correspond
 with the skin.

 FIDUCIAL - You can apply a rigid body realignment based on three fiducial
 locations. After realigning, the fiducials in the input electrode set (typically
 nose, left and right ear) are along the same axes as the fiducials in the template
 electrode set.

 TEMPLATE - You can apply a spatial transformation/deformation that automatically
 minimizes the distance between the electrodes or gradiometers and a template or
 sensor array. The warping methods use a non-linear search to minimize the distance
 between the input sensor positions and the corresponding template sensors.

 HEADSHAPE - You can apply a spatial transformation/deformation that automatically
 minimizes the distance between the electrodes and the head surface. The warping
 methods use a non-linear search to minimize the distance between the input sensor
 positions and the projection of the electrodes on the head surface.

 PROJECT - This projects all electrodes to the nearest point on the
 head surface mesh.

 MOVEINWARD - This moves all electrodes inward according to their normals

 Use as
   [elec_realigned] = ft_sensorrealign(cfg)
 with the electrode or gradiometer details in the configuration, or as
   [elec_realigned] = ft_sensorrealign(cfg, elec_orig)
 with the electrode or gradiometer definition as 2nd input argument.

 The configuration can contain the following options
   cfg.method         = string representing the method for aligning or placing the electrodes
                        'interactive'     realign manually using a graphical user interface
                        'fiducial'        realign using three fiducials (e.g. NAS, LPA and RPA)
                        'template'        realign the electrodes to match a template set
                        'headshape'       realign the electrodes to fit the head surface

                        'moveinward'      moves electrodes inward along their normals
   cfg.warp          = string describing the spatial transformation for the template and headshape methods
                        'rigidbody'       apply a rigid-body warp (default)
                        'globalrescale'   apply a rigid-body warp with global rescaling
                        'traditional'     apply a rigid-body warp with individual axes rescaling
                        'nonlin1'         apply a 1st order non-linear warp
                        'nonlin2'         apply a 2nd order non-linear warp
                        'nonlin3'         apply a 3rd order non-linear warp
                        'nonlin4'         apply a 4th order non-linear warp
                        'nonlin5'         apply a 5th order non-linear warp
                        'dykstra2012'     back-project ECoG onto the cortex using energy minimzation
                        'hermes2010'      back-project ECoG onto the cortex along the local norm vector
                        'fsaverage'       surface-based realignment with FreeSurfer fsaverage brain (left->left or right->right)
                        'fsaverage_sym'   surface-based realignment with FreeSurfer fsaverage_sym left hemisphere (left->left or right->left)
                        'fsinflated'      surface-based realignment with FreeSurfer individual subject inflated brain (left->left or right->right)
   cfg.channel        = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
                        see  FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.keepchannel    = string, 'yes' or 'no' (default = 'no')
   cfg.fiducial       = cell-array with the name of three fiducials used for
                        realigning (default = {'nasion', 'lpa', 'rpa'})
   cfg.casesensitive  = 'yes' or 'no', determines whether string comparisons
                        between electrode labels are case sensitive (default = 'yes')
   cfg.feedback       = 'yes' or 'no' (default = 'no')

 The electrode positions can be present in the 2nd input argument or can be specified as
   cfg.elec          = structure with electrode positions or filename, see FT_READ_SENS

 If you want to realign the EEG electrodes using anatomical fiducials, you should
 specify the target location of the three fiducials, e.g.
   cfg.target.pos(1,:) = [110 0 0]     % location of the nose
   cfg.target.pos(2,:) = [0  90 0]     % location of the left ear
   cfg.target.pos(3,:) = [0 -90 0]     % location of the right ear
   cfg.target.label    = {'NAS', 'LPA', 'RPA'}

 If you want to align EEG electrodes to a single or multiple template electrode sets
 (which will be averaged), you should specify the template electrode sets either as
 electrode structures (i.e. when they are already read in memory) or their file
 names using
   cfg.target          = single electrode set that serves as standard
 or
   cfg.target{1..N}    = list of electrode sets that will be averaged

 If you want to align EEG electrodes to the head surface, you should specify the head surface as
   cfg.headshape      = a filename containing headshape, a structure containing a
                        single triangulated boundary, or a Nx3 matrix with surface
                        points

 If you want to align ECoG electrodes to the pial surface, you first need to compute
 the cortex hull with FT_PREPARE_MESH. Then use either the algorithm described in
 Dykstra et al. (2012, Neuroimage) or in Hermes et al. (2010, J Neurosci methods) to
 snap the electrodes back to the cortical hull, e.g.
   cfg.method         = 'headshape'
   cfg.warp           = 'dykstra2012', or 'hermes2010'
   cfg.headshape      = a filename containing headshape, a structure containing a
                        single triangulated boundary, or a Nx3 matrix with surface
                        points
   cfg.feedback       = 'yes' or 'no' (default), feedback of the iteration procedure

 Additional configuration options for cfg.warp = 'dykstra2012'
   cfg.maxiter        = number (default: 50), maximum number of optimization iterations
   cfg.pairmethod     = 'pos' (default) or 'label', the method for electrode
                        pairing on which the deformation energy is based
   cfg.isodistance    = 'yes', 'no' (default) or number, to enforce isotropic
                        inter-electrode distances (pairmethod 'label' only)
   cfg.deformweight   = number (default: 1), weight of deformation relative 
                        to shift energy cost (lower increases grid flexibility)

 If you want to move the electrodes inward, you should specify
   cfg.moveinward     = number, the distance that the electrode should be moved
                        inward (negative numbers result in an outward move)

 If you want to align ECoG electrodes to the freesurfer average brain, you should
 specify the path to your headshape (e.g., lh.pial), and ensure you have the
 corresponding registration file (e.g., lh.sphere.reg) in the same directory.
 Moreover, the path to the local freesurfer home is required. Note that, because the
 electrodes are being aligned to the fsaverage brain, the corresponding brain should
 be also used when plotting the data, i.e. use freesurfer/subjects/fsaverage/surf/lh.pial
 rather than surface_pial_left.mat
   cfg.method         = 'headshape'
   cfg.warp           = 'fsaverage'
   cfg.headshape      = string, filename containing subject headshape (e.g. <path to freesurfer/surf/lh.pial>)
   cfg.fshome         = string, path to freesurfer
