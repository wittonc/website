```
 FT_HEADMODEL_FNS creates the volume conduction structure to be used
 in the FNS forward solver.

 Use as
   headmodel = ft_headmodel_fns(seg, ...)

 Optional input arguments should be specified in key-value pairs and
 can include
   tissuecond       = matrix C [9XN tissue types]; where N is the number of
                      tissues and a 3x3 tensor conductivity matrix is stored
                      in each column.
   tissue           = see fns_contable_write
   tissueval        = match tissues of segmentation input
   transform        = 4x4 transformation matrix (default eye(4))
   sens             = sensor information (for which ft_datatype(sens,'sens')==1)
   deepelec         = used in the case of deep voxel solution
   tolerance        = scalar (default 1e-8)

 Standard default values for conductivity matrix C are derived from

 inhomogeneous anisotropic bioelectric problems. IEEE Trans Biomed Eng.
