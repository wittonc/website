```
 FT_ELECTRODERMALACTIVITY estimates the electrodermal activity from a recording of
 the electric resistance of the skin.

 Use as
   eda = ft_electrodermalactivity(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 The configuration structure has the following options
   cfg.channel        = selected channel for processing, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION
   cfg.feedback       = 'yes' or 'no'
   cfg.medianwindow   = scalar, length of window for median filter in seconds (default = 8)

 After using this function you can use FT_REDEFINETRIAL and FT_TIMELOCKANLAYSIS to
 investigate electrodermal responses (EDRs) to stimulation. You can use
 FT_ARTIFACT_THRESHOLD to determine the timing and frequency of nonspecific EDRs.

 See https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2012.01384.x "Publication recommendations
 for electrodermal measurements" by the SPR for an introduction in electrodermal
 methods and for recommendations.
