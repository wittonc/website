```
 FT_WARP_OPTIM determine intermediate positions using warping (deformation)
 the input cloud of points is warped to match the target.
 The strategy is to start with simpelest linear warp, followed by a more
 elaborate linear warp, which then is followed by the nonlinear warps up
 to the desired order.

 [result, M] = ft_warp_pnt(input, target, method)
     input          contains the Nx3 measured 3D positions
     target         contains the Nx3 template 3D positions
     method         should be any of 
                     'rigidbody'
                     'globalrescale'
                     'traditional' (default)
                     'nonlin1'
                     'nonlin2'
                     'nonlin3'
                     'nonlin4'
                     'nonlin5'

 The default warping method is a traditional linear warp with individual
 rescaling in each dimension. Optionally you can select a nonlinear warp
 of the 1st (affine) up to the 5th order.

 When available, this function will use the MATLAB optimization toolbox.
