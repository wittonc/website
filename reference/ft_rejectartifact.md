```
 FT_REJECTARTIFACT removes data segments containing artifacts. It returns a
 configuration structure with a modified trial definition which can be used for
 preprocessing of only the clean data.

 You should start by detecting the artifacts in the data using the function
 FT_ARTIFACT_xxx where xxx is the type of artifact. Subsequently FT_REJECTARTIFACT
 looks at the detected artifacts and removes them from the trial definition or from
 the data. In case you wish to replace bad parts by nans, you have to specify data
 as an input parameter.

 Use as
   cfg = ft_rejectartifact(cfg)
 with the cfg as obtained from FT_DEFINETRIAL, or as
   data = ft_rejectartifact(cfg, data)
 with the data as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING

 The following configuration options are supported:
   cfg.artfctdef.reject          = 'none', 'partial', 'complete', 'nan', or 'value' (default = 'complete')
   cfg.artfctdef.minaccepttim    = when using partial rejection, minimum length
                                   in seconds of remaining trial (default = 0.1)
   cfg.artfctdef.crittoilim      = when using complete rejection, reject trial only when artifacts occur within
                                   this time window (default = whole trial). This only works with in-memory data,
                                   since trial time axes are unknown for data on disk.
   cfg.artfctdef.feedback        = 'yes' or 'no' (default = 'no')
   cfg.artfctdef.invert          = 'yes' or 'no' (default = 'no')
   cfg.artfctdef.value           = scalar value to replace the data in the artifact segments (default = nan)
   cfg.artfctdef.eog.artifact    = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this is added to the cfg by using FT_ARTIFACT_EOG
   cfg.artfctdef.jump.artifact   = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this is added to the cfg by using FT_ARTIFACT_JUMP
   cfg.artfctdef.muscle.artifact = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this is added to the cfg by using FT_ARTIFACT_MUSCLE
   cfg.artfctdef.zvalue.artifact = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this is added to the cfg by using FT_ARTIFACT_ZVALUE
   cfg.artfctdef.visual.artifact = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this is added to the cfg by using FT_DATABROWSER
   cfg.artfctdef.xxx.artifact    = Nx2 matrix with artifact segments, this could be added by your own artifact detection function

 A trial that contains an artifact can be rejected completely or partially. In case
 of partial rejection, a minimum length of the resulting sub-trials can be
 specified using minaccepttim.

 Output:
   If cfg is used as the only input parameter, the output is a cfg structure with an updated trl.
   If cfg and data are both input parameters, the output is an updated raw data structure with only the clean data segments.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 If you specify this option the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk. This mat files should contain only a single variable named 'data',
 corresponding to the input structure.
