title: ft_source2full

```
 FT_SOURCE2FULL recreates the grid locations outside the brain in the source 
 reconstruction, so that the source volume again describes the full grid.
 This undoes the memory savings that can be achieved using FT_SOURCE2SPARSE
 and makes it possible again to plot  the source volume and save it to an
 external file.

 Use as
   [source] = ft_source2full(source)
