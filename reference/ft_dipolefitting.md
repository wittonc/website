 FT_DIPOLEFITTING perform grid search and non-linear fit with one or multiple
 dipoles and try to find the location where the dipole model is best able
 to explain the measured EEG or MEG topography.

 This function will initially scan the whole brain with a single dipole on
 a regular coarse grid, and subsequently start at the most optimal location
 with a non-linear search. Alternatively you can specify the initial
 location of the dipole(s) and the non-linear search will start from there.

 Use as
   [source] = ft_dipolefitting(cfg, data)

 The configuration has the following general fields
   cfg.numdipoles  = number, default is 1
   cfg.symmetry    = 'x', 'y' or 'z' symmetry for two dipoles, can be empty (default = [])
   cfg.channel     = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels (default = 'all'),
                     see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.gridsearch  = 'yes' or 'no', perform global search for initial
                     guess for the dipole parameters (default = 'yes')
   cfg.nonlinear   = 'yes' or 'no', perform nonlinear search for optimal
                     dipole parameters (default = 'yes')

 If you start with a grid search, the complete grid with dipole positions and
 optionally precomputed leadfields is constructed using FT_PREPARE_SOURCEMODEL. It
 can be specified as as a regular 3-D grid that is aligned with the axes of the head
 coordinate system using
   cfg.xgrid               = vector (e.g. -20:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.ygrid               = vector (e.g. -20:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.zgrid               = vector (e.g.   0:1:20) or 'auto' (default = 'auto')
   cfg.resolution          = number (e.g. 1 cm) for automatic grid generation
 If the source model destribes a triangulated cortical sheet, it is described as
   cfg.sourcemodel.pos     = N*3 matrix with the vertex positions of the cortical sheet
   cfg.sourcemodel.tri     = M*3 matrix that describes the triangles connecting the vertices
 Alternatively the position of a few dipoles at locations of interest can be
 user-specified, for example obtained from an anatomical or functional MRI
   cfg.sourcemodel.pos     = N*3 matrix with position of each source
   cfg.sourcemodel.inside  = N*1 vector with boolean value whether grid point is inside brain (optional)
   cfg.sourcemodel.dim     = [Nx Ny Nz] vector with dimensions in case of 3-D grid (optional)

 If you do not start with a grid search, you have to give a starting location
 for the nonlinear search
   cfg.dip.pos     = initial dipole position, matrix of Ndipoles x 3

 The conventional approach is to fit dipoles to event-related averages, which
 within FieldTrip can be obtained from the FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS or from
 the FT_TIMELOCKGRANDAVERAGE function. This has the additional options
   cfg.latency     = [begin end] in seconds or 'all' (default = 'all')
   cfg.model       = 'moving' or 'regional'
 A moving dipole model has a different position (and orientation) for each
 timepoint, or for each component. A regional dipole model has the same
 position for each timepoint or component, and a different orientation.

 You can also fit dipoles to the spatial topographies of an independent
 component analysis, obtained from the FT_COMPONENTANALYSIS function.
 This has the additional options
   cfg.component   = array with numbers (can be empty -> all)

 You can also fit dipoles to the spatial topographies that are present
 in the data in the frequency domain, which can be obtained using the
 FT_FREQANALYSIS function. This has the additional options
   cfg.frequency   = single number (in Hz)

 Low level details of the fitting can be specified in the cfg.dipfit structure
   cfg.dipfit.display  = level of display, can be 'off', 'iter', 'notify' or 'final' (default = 'iter')
   cfg.dipfit.optimfun = function to use, can be 'fminsearch' or 'fminunc' (default is determined automatic)
   cfg.dipfit.maxiter  = maximum number of function evaluations allowed (default depends on the optimfun)

 Optionally, you can modify the leadfields by reducing the rank, i.e. remove the weakest orientation
   cfg.reducerank      = 'no', or number (default = 3 for EEG, 2 for MEG)


 The volume conduction model of the head should be specified as
   cfg.headmodel     = structure with volume conduction model, see FT_PREPARE_HEADMODEL

 The EEG or MEG sensor positions can be present in the data or can be specified as
   cfg.elec          = structure with electrode positions or filename, see FT_READ_SENS
   cfg.grad          = structure with gradiometer definition or filename, see FT_READ_SENS

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
