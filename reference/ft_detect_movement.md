 FT_SACCADE_DETECTION performs detection of movements such as saccades and
 microsaccades, but also joystick movements, from time series data over multiple
 trials. Different methods for detecting movements are implemented, which are
 described in detail below:

 VELOCITY2D - detects micro/saccades using a two-dimensional (2D) velocity according
 to "Engbert R, Kliegl R (2003) Vision Res 43:1035-1045". The vertical and the
 horizontal eyetracker time series (for one eye) are transformed into velocities and
 microsaccades are indentified as "outlier" eye movements that exceed a given
 threshold for velocity and duration. This method has the additional options
     cfg.velocity2D.kernel   = vector 1 x nsamples, kernel to compute velocity (default = [1 1 0 -1 -1].*(data.fsample/6);
     cfg.velocity2D.demean   = 'no' or 'yes', whether to apply centering correction (default = 'yes')
     cfg.velocity2D.mindur   = minimum microsaccade durantion in samples (default = 3);
     cfg.velocity2D.velthres = threshold for velocity outlier detection (default = 6);

 CLUSTERING - detects movements according to "Otero-Millan et al., (2014) J Vis 14".

 Use as
   [cfg, movement] = ft_detect_movement(cfg, data)
 where the input data should be organised in a structure as obtained from the
 FT_PREPROCESSING function.

 The configuration can contain the following options
   cfg.method  = string representing the method for movement detection
                 'velocity2D' detects microsaccades using the 2D velocity
                 'clustering' use unsupervised clustering method to detect microsaccades
   cfg.channel = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details, (default = 'all')
   cfg.trials  = 'all' or a selection given as a 1xN vector (default = 'all')

 The output argument "movement" is a Nx3 matrix. The first and second columns
 specify the begining and end samples of a movement period (saccade, joystick, ...),
 and the third column contains the peak velocity/acceleration movement. The thrid
 column allows to convert movements into spike data representation, making it
 compatible with the spike toolbox functions.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
