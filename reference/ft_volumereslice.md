```
 FT_VOLUMERESLICE flips, permutes, interpolates and reslices a volume along the
 principal axes of the coordinate system according to a specified resolution.

 Use as
   mri = ft_volumereslice(cfg, mri)
 where the input MRI should be a single anatomical or functional MRI volume that
 results from FT_READ_MRI or FT_VOLUMEREALIGN. You can visualize the the input and
 output using FT_SOURCEPLOT.

 The configuration structure can contain
   cfg.method     = string, 'flip', 'nearest', 'linear', 'cubic' or 'spline' (default = 'linear')
   cfg.downsample = integer number (default = 1, i.e. no downsampling)

 If you specify the method as 'flip', it will only permute and flip the volume, but
 not perform any interpolation. For the other methods the input volumetric data will
 also be interpolated on a regular voxel grid.

 For the interpolation methods you should specify
   cfg.resolution = number, in physical units
   cfg.xrange     = [min max], in physical units
   cfg.yrange     = [min max], in physical units
   cfg.zrange     = [min max], in physical units
 or alternatively with
   cfg.dim        = [nx ny nz], size of the volume in each direction

 If the input MRI has a coordsys-field and you don't specify explicit the
 xrange/yrange/zrange, the centre of the volume will be shifted (with respect to the
 origin of the coordinate system), for the brain to fit nicely in the box.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
