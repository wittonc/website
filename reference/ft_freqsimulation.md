 FT_FREQSIMULATION makes simulated data in FieldTrip format. The data is
 built up from fifferent frequencies and can contain a signal in which the
 different frequencies interact (i.e. cross-frequency coherent). Different
 methods are possible to make data with special properties.

 Use as
   [data] = ft_freqsimulation(cfg)

 The configuration options can include
   cfg.method     = The methods are explained in more detail below, but they can be
                     'superimposed'    simply add the contribution of the different frequencies
                     'broadband'       create a single broadband signal component
                     'phalow_amphigh'  phase of low freq correlated with amplitude of high freq
                     'amplow_amphigh'  amplitude of low freq correlated with amplithude of high freq
                     'phalow_freqhigh' phase of low freq correlated with frequency of high signal
                     'asymmetric'      single signal component with asymmetric positive/negative deflections
   cfg.output     = which channels should be in the output data, can be 'mixed' or 'all' (default = 'all')
   cfg.randomseed = 'yes' or a number or vector with the seed value (default = 'yes')

 The number of trials and the time axes of the trials can be specified by
   cfg.fsample    = simulated sample frequency
   cfg.trllen     = length of simulated trials in seconds
   cfg.numtrl     = number of simulated trials
 or by
   cfg.time       = cell-array with one time axis per trial, which are for example obtained from an existing dataset

 For each of the methods default parameters are configured to generate
 example data, including noise. To get full control over the generated
 data you should explicitely set all parameters involved in the method
 of your choise. The interpretation of the following signal components
 depends on the specified method:

 cfg.s1.freq     = frequency of signal 1
 cfg.s1.phase    = phase (in rad) relative to cosine of signal 1  (default depends on method)
                 = number or 'random'
 cfg.s1.ampl     = amplitude of signal 1
 cfg.s2.freq     = frequency of signal 2
 cfg.s2.phase    = phase (in rad) relative to cosine of signal 1  (default depends on method)
                 = number or 'random'
 cfg.s2.ampl     = amplitude of signal 2
 cfg.s3.freq     = frequency of signal 3
 cfg.s3.phase    = phase (in rad) relative to cosine of signal 1  (default depends on method)
                 = number or 'random'
 cfg.s3.ampl     = amplitude of signal 3
 cfg.s4.freq     = frequency of signal 4
 cfg.s4.phase    = phase (in rad) relative to cosine of signal 1  (default depends on method)
                 = number or 'random'
 cfg.s4.ampl     = amplitude of signal 4

 cfg.n1.ampl     = root-mean-square amplitude of wide-band signal prior to filtering
 cfg.n1.bpfreq   = [Flow Fhigh]
 cfg.n2.ampl     = root-mean-square amplitude of wide-band signal prior to filtering
 cfg.n2.bpfreq   = [Flow Fhigh]

 cfg.asymmetry   = amount of asymmetry (default = 0, which is none)
 cfg.noise.ampl  = amplitude of noise


 In the method 'superimposed' the signal contains just the sum of the different frequency contributions:
     s1: first frequency
     s2: second frequency
     s3: third frequency
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = s1 + s2 + s3 + noise
     2nd channel: s1
     3rd channel: s2
     4th channel: s3
     5th channel: noise

 In the method 'broadband' the signal contains a the superposition of two
 broadband signal components, which are created by bandpass filtering a
 Gaussian noise signal:
     n1: first broadband signal
     n2: second broadband signal
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = n1 + n2 + noise
     2nd channel: n1
     3rd channel: n2
     4th channel: noise

 In the method 'phalow_amphigh' the signal is build up of 4 components; s1, s2, s3 and noise:
     s1: amplitude modulation (AM), frequency of this signal should be lower than s2
     s2: second frequency, frequncy that becomes amplitude modulated
     s3: DC shift of s1, should have frequency of 0
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = (s1 + s3)*s2 + noise,
     2nd channel: s1
     3rd channel: s2
     4th channel: s3
     5th channel: noise

 In the method 'amplow_amphigh' the signal is build up of 5 components; s1, s2, s3, s4 and noise.
     s1: first frequency
     s2: second frequency
     s3: DC shift of s1 and s2, should have frequency of 0
     s4: amplitude modulation (AM), frequency of this signal should be lower than s1 and s2
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = (s4 + s3)*s1 + (s4 + s3)*s2 + noise,
     2nd channel: s1
     3rd channel: s2
     4th channel: s3
     5th channel: noise
     6th channel: s4
     7th channel: mixed part 1: (s4 + s3)*s1
     8th channel: mixed part 2: (s4 + s3)*s2

 In the method 'phalow_freqhigh' a frequency modulated signal is created.
   signal is build up of 3 components; s1, s2 and noise.
     s1: represents the base signal that will be modulated
     s2: signal that will be used for the frequency modulation
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = s1.ampl * cos(ins_pha) + noise
     2nd channel: s1
     3rd channel: s2
     4th channel: noise
     5th channel: inst_pha_base   instantaneous phase of the high (=base) frequency signal s1
     6th channel: inst_pha_mod    low frequency phase modulation, this is equal to s2
     7th channel: inst_pha        instantaneous phase, i.e. inst_pha_base + inst_pha_mod

 In the method 'asymmetric' there is only one periodic signal, but that
 signal is more peaked for the positive than for the negative deflections.
 The average of the signal over time is zero.
     s1: represents the frequency of the base signal
 and the output consists of the following channels:
     1st channel: mixed signal = asymmetric signal + noise
     2nd channel: sine wave with base frequency and phase, i.e. s1
     3rd channel: asymmetric signal
     4th channel: noise
