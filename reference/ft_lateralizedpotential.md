 FT_LATERALIZEDPOTENTIAL computes lateralized potentials such as the
 lateralized readiness potential (LRP)

 Use as
   [lrp] = ft_lateralizedpotential(cfg, avgL, avgR)

 where the input datasets should come from FT_TIMELOCKANALYSIS
 and the configuration should contain
   cfg.channelcmb = Nx2 cell-array

 An example channelcombination containing the homologous channels
 in the 10-20 standard system is
    cfg.channelcmb = {'Fp1'   'Fp2'
                      'F7'    'F8'
                      'F3'    'F4'
                      'T7'    'T8'
                      'C3'    'C4'
                      'P7'    'P8'
                      'P3'    'P4'
                      'O1'    'O2'}

 The lateralized potential is computed on combinations of channels and
 not on indivudual channels. However, if you want to make a topographic
 plot with e.g. FT_MULTIPLOTER, you can replace the output lrp.label
 with lrp.plotlabel.

 The concept for the LRP was introduced approximately simultaneously in the
 following two papers
 - M. G. H. Coles. Modern mind-brain reading - psychophysiology,
   physiology, and cognition. Psychophysiology, 26(3):251-269, 1988.
 - R. de Jong, M. Wierda, G. Mulder, and L. J. Mulder. Use of
   partial stimulus information in response processing. J Exp Psychol
   Hum Percept Perform, 14:682-692, 1988.
 and it is discussed in detail on a technical level in
 - R. Oostenveld, D.F. Stegeman, P. Praamstra and A. van Oosterom.
   Brain symmetry and topographic analysis of lateralized event-related
   potentials. Clin Neurophysiol. 114(7):1194-202, 2003.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
