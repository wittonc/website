```
 FT_HEADMODEL_SLAB creates an EEG volume conduction model that
 is described with an infinite conductive slab. You can think
 of this as two parallel planes containing a mass of conductive
 material (e.g. water) and externally to them a non-conductive material
 (e.g. air).

 Use as
   headmodel = ft_headmodel_slab(mesh1, mesh2, Pc, varargin)
 where
   mesh1.pos = Nx3 vector specifying N points through which the 'upper' plane is fitted 
   mesh2.pos = Nx3 vector specifying N points through which the 'lower' plane is fitted 
   Pc        = 1x3 vector specifying the spatial position of a point lying in the conductive slab 
              (this determines the plane's normal's direction)
 
 Optional arguments should be specified in key-value pairs and can include
   'sourcemodel'  = 'monopole' 
   'conductivity' = number ,  conductivity value of the conductive halfspace (default = 1)
