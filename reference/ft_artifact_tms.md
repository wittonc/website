```
 FT_ARTIFACT_TMS reads the data segments of interest from file and identifies artefacts in
 EEG recordings that were done during TMS stimulation.

 Use as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_tms(cfg)
 with the configuration options
   cfg.dataset     = string with the filename
 or
   cfg.headerfile  = string with the filename
   cfg.datafile    = string with the filename
 and optionally
   cfg.headerformat
   cfg.dataformat

 Alternatively you can use it as
   [cfg, artifact] = ft_artifact_tms(cfg, data)
 where the input data is a structure as obtained from FT_PREPROCESSING.

 In both cases the configuration should also contain
   cfg.trl         = structure that defines the data segments of interest, see FT_DEFINETRIAL
   cfg.continuous  = 'yes' or 'no' whether the file contains continuous data (default = 'yes')
 and
   cfg.method      = 'detect' or 'marker', see below.
   cfg.prestim     = scalar, time in seconds prior to onset of detected event to mark as artifactual (default = 0.005 seconds)
   cfg.poststim    = scalar, time in seconds post onset of detected even to mark as artifactual (default = 0.010 seconds)

 The different methods are described in detail below.

 With cfg.method='detect', TMS-artifact are detected on basis of transient
 high-amplidude gradients that are typical for TMS-pulses. The data is preprocessed
 (again) with the following settings, which are optimal for identifying TMS-pulses.
 Artifacts are identified by means of thresholding the z-transformed value of the
 preprocessed data. This method acts as a wrapper around FT_ARTIFACT_ZVALUE.
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.derivative  = 'yes'
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.channel     = Nx1 cell-array with selection of channels, see FT_CHANNELSELECTION for details
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.cutoff      = z-value at which to threshold (default = 4)
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.trlpadding  = 0.1
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.fltpadding  = 0.1
   cfg.artfctdef.tms.artpadding  = 0.01
 Be aware that if one artifact falls within this specified range of another artifact, both
 artifact will be counted as one. Depending on cfg.prestim and cfg.poststim you may not mark
 enough data as artifactual.

 With cfg.method='marker', TMS-artifact onsets and offsets are based on markers/triggers that
 are written into the EEG dataset. This method acts as a wrapper around FT_DEFINETRIAL to
 determine on- and offsets of TMS pulses by reading markers in the EEG.
   cfg.trialfun            = function name, see below (default = 'ft_trialfun_general')
   cfg.trialdef.eventtype  = 'string'
   cfg.trialdef.eventvalue = number, string or list with numbers or strings
 The cfg.trialfun option is a string containing the name of a function that you wrote
 yourself and that FT_ARTIFACT_TMS will call. The function should take the cfg-structure as
 input and should give a NxM matrix with M equal to or larger than 3) in the same format as
 "trl" as the output. You can add extra custom fields to the configuration structure to
 pass as arguments to your own trialfun.  Furthermore, inside the trialfun you can use the
 FT_READ_EVENT function to get the event information from your data file.

 The output argument "artifact" is a Nx2 matrix comparable to the
 "trl" matrix of FT_DEFINETRIAL. The first column of which specifying the
 beginsamples of an artifact period, the second column contains the
 endsamples of the artifactperiods.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing with the peer-to-peer
 module, this function has the following option:
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
 If you specify this option the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk. This mat files should contain only a single variable named 'data',
 corresponding to the input structure.
