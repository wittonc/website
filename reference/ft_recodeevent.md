 FT_RECODEEVENT will recode the event structure, given the trial
 definition that was analyzed

 In FieldTrip, you always start with defining a "trl" field containing
 the samples in the raw datafile that you want to analyze. That "trl"
 is based on the events in the dataset. After artifact rejection, it may
 be the case that trials have been removed completely, or that trials
 have been cut into pieces. This complicates finding a match between the
 original events and the pieces of data that are analyzed. This functino
 restores that match.

 Use as
   [ev] = ft_recodeevent(cfg, data)
 where cfg is a structure with configuration settings and data contains the
 (nested) configuration that describes the original trial definition and
 event structure.

 Alternatively, you can also specify the event structure and trial definition
 yourself with
   [ev] = ft_recodeevent(cfg, event, trl)

 the configuration can contain
   cfg.eventtype   = empty, 'string' or cell-array with multiple strings
   cfg.eventvalue  = empty or a list of event values (can be numeric or string)

   cfg.searchrange = 'anywhere'      search anywhere for the event, (default)
                     'insidetrial'   only search inside
                     'outsidetrial'  only search outside
                     'beforetrial'   only search before the trial
                     'aftertrial'    only search after  the trial
                     'beforezero'    only search before time t=0 of each trial
                     'afterzero'     only search after  time t=0 of each trial

   cfg.nearestto   = 'trialzero'     compare with time t=0 for each trial (default)
                     'trialbegin'    compare with the begin of each trial
                     'trialend'      compare with the end of each trial

   cfg.match       = 'exact' or 'nearest'

   cfg.output      = 'event'             the event itself
                     'eventvalue'        the value of the event
                     'eventnumber'       the number of the event
                     'samplenumber'      the sample at which the event is located
                     'samplefromoffset'  number of samples from t=0 (c.f. response time)
                     'samplefrombegin'   number of samples from the begin of the trial
                     'samplefromend'     number of samples from the end   of the trial
