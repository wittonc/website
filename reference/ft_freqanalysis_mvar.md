```
 FT_FREQANALYSIS_MVAR performs frequency analysis on
 mvar data, by fourier transformation of the coefficients. The output
 contains cross-spectral density, spectral transfer matrix, and the
 covariance of the innovation noise. The dimord = 'chan_chan(_freq)(_time)

 The function is stand-alone, but is typically called through
 FT_FREQANALYSIS, specifying cfg.method = 'mvar'.

 Use as
   [freq] = ft_freqanalysis(cfg, data), with cfg.method = 'mvar'

 or

   [freq] = ft_freqanalysis_mvar(cfg, data)

 The input data structure should be a data structure created by
 FT_MVARANALYSIS, i.e. a data-structure of type 'mvar'.

 The configuration can contain:
   cfg.foi = vector with the frequencies at which the spectral quantities
               are estimated (in Hz). Default: 0:1:Nyquist
   cfg.feedback = 'none', or any of the methods supported by FT_PROGRESS,
                    for providing feedback to the user in the command
                    window.

 To facilitate data-handling and distributed computing you can use
   cfg.inputfile   =  ...
   cfg.outputfile  =  ...
 If you specify one of these (or both) the input data will be read from a *.mat
 file on disk and/or the output data will be written to a *.mat file. These mat
 files should contain only a single variable, corresponding with the
 input/output structure.
