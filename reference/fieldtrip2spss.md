 FIELDTRIP2SPSS compiles data and correpsonding labels into a textfile,
 suitable for importing into SPSS or JASP (jasp-stats.org).

 Use as
   fieldtrip2spss(filename, labels, data)

 When exporting from MATLAB, set:
   - filename; should be string (e.g. 'counts.txt')
   - labels; should be a cell-array (e.g. {'ones', 'twos', 'threes'})
   - data; should be either a vector or matrix (e.g. [1 2 3; 1 2 3; 1 2 3])

 When importing to SPSS, set;
   - variables included at top of file: 'yes'
   - first case of data on line number: '2' (default)
   - delimiter appearing between variables: 'tab' (default)

 In case the columns that make up the data matrix have unequal lengths
 (e.g. because of different number of subjects per group), use:
   data         = ones(30,2)*9999
   data(1:30,1) = 1 (30 subj in Group 1)
   data(1:20,2) = 2 (20 subj in Group 2)
 After importing to SPSS, click the Missing cell in the Variable View
 window and enter 9999 as the missing value definition.
```
