# Accessing the FieldTrip source code through CVS

Initial development of the FieldTrip code started using CVS, the Concurrent Versions System. Around 2009 we switched over to SVN. In February 2016 we switched over to [Git](http://git-scm.com) and you can now access the code and contribute on [GitHub](http://github.com/fieldtrip).

Please see our [GitHub tutorial](/development/git) for details.
