# Accessing the FieldTrip source code through SVN

The FieldTrip code base used to be managed using the Subversion source code version control system, also known as SVN. In February 2016 we switched over to [Git](http://git-scm.com) and you can now access the code and contribute on [GitHub](http://github.com/fieldtrip).

Please see our [GitHub tutorial](/development/git) for details.
