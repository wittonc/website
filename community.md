# Community

The FieldTrip project (i.e. software, documentation, website and everything around it) receives many valuable contributions from its community. The community is for a large part organized around the [discussion list](/discussion_list) and the website you are currently browsing. Please [look here](/contribute) for how you can contribute.

We also have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/), which shows [photos](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/photos/), for example of past workshops, and where [events](https://www.facebook.com/fieldtriptoolbox/events/) are announced occasionally.
Please note that we are not actively providing support for the use of the toolbox on Facebook.

## Support

The best way to get support is to ask your questions to the community of users and developers on the [discussion list](/discussion_list).

Another way is by attending one of the upcoming [workshops](/workshop).

## The larger community

FieldTrip is not the only MEG/EEG analysis toolbox. We collaborate with other methods research groups, software developpers and various companies. See the page with [external links](/external_links).
