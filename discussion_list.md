# Discussion List

Note that the main FieldTrip developers cannot answer individual questions. Please ask the community for support on the FieldTrip [email discussion list](http://mailman.science.ru.nl/mailman/listinfo/fieldtrip). Its aim is to facilitate the discussion between both users and developers, to share expertise among users and to discuss new ideas for analysis.

You can send send an email to <fieldtrip-subscribe@science.ru.nl> to subscribe to the FieldTrip list, or to <fieldtrip-unsubscribe@science.ru.nl> to unsubscribe. Only people who are subscribed to the discussion list can send and will receive messages. Once subscribed you can send your questions and contributions to <fieldtrip@science.ru.nl>.

## Ask efficient questions

The community of users and developers is always happy to try to help you with your questions, but note that it helps if you ask your question in a to-the-point way and provide as much (necessary) information as possible. Please read our FAQ on [how to ask good questionsto the FieldTrip community](/faq/how_to_ask_good_questions_to_the_community) and consider these [Ten Simple Rules for Getting Help from Online Scientific Communities](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002202).
