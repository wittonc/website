# Contribute

FieldTrip is an [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org) project with contributions from various individual users and research groups.

There are various ways in which **_you can contribute_** to FieldTrip.

## Share your expertise

The FieldTrip community is organized around the [email discussion list](/discussion_list). You can contribute your expertise by helping other people, answering questions from other people on the email list, or posting your ideas.

## Report bugs or request enhancements

You can [provide us with detailed bug reports](/bugzilla). The easier it is for one of us to reproduce the bug, the more likely it is that we can fix the problem. You can use the same approach to request new functionality. We cannot guarantee that we have time to implement it, but it is good to know what people are trying to do or would like to do with FieldTrip.

## Contribute code

You can contribute by directly sharing your MATLAB code with us and helping us integrate it into the FieldTrip toolbox. On the [development section of this website](/development) you can find more details on how the development is organized. You can of course also [ask](/contact).

If yor contribution is considerable, for example a completely new algorithm, there are some additional requirements. Your code contribution must be in FieldTrip style, the algorithm must be of broad interest (i.e. more than a single lab), must be maintainable and must be documented not only with help in the code, but also on the website as a tutorial or as example script.

{% include markup/info %}
When you contribute code, please consider the [code guidelines](/development/guideline/code) to keep it consistent and compatible with the existing implementation. Also try to adhere to the existing representation of the data in the [data structures](/faq/how_are_the_various_data_structures_defined).
{% include markup/end %}

## Contribute documentation

You are invited to add your own tutorials, example scripts or answers to frequently asked questions to this website. Every time you type an email explaining something, please consider adding it here as well to increase the long term impact.

You can contribute directly to the documentation on this website by going to [the `fieldtrip/website` GitHub repo](https://github.com/fieldtrip/website), editing or adding a page there and sending your suggestion as a "pull request". All contributions are reviewed by the maintainers. If you are not sure about the quality of your contribution, just submit it as pull request and we will check, improve and/or provide feedback if needed.

{% include markup/info %}
When adding documentation, please consider the [documentation guidelines](/development/guideline/documentation) to keep it consistent with other documentation and to facilitate cross-linking.
