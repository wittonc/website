# About the FieldTrip project

FieldTrip is being developed and maintained at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](http://www.ru.nl/donders), part of the [Radboud University](http://www.ru.nl) in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in close collaboration with [collaborating institutes](/external_links#collaborating_institutes). The development of FieldTrip currently receives support from the [ChildBrain](http://www.childbrain.eu) project and from [the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](http://www.nwo.nl) and has previously been supported by the [Human Connectome](http://humanconnectome.org) project and [BrainGain](http://www.braingain.nl).

## Contact

The development is led by Robert Oostenveld and Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen, and receives many valuable contributions from present and past colleagues from the Donders and many contributors over the world.

If you have questions about the **use of FieldTrip**, you should post them on the [email discussion list](/discussion_list).

If you want to **report a malfunctioning** of the FieldTrip code, please use our [issue tracking system](/bugzilla). The easier it is for one of the developers to reproduce the bug, the more likely it is that we can fix the problem for you. Good bug reports include a small test script and the data (i.e. mat file) required to reproduce the bug.

For questions that are **not suitable** for the public email list, e.g. discussing potential contributions to the toolbox or requests for organizing a local workshop, you can send an email to Robert Oostenveld (robert.oostenveld at donders.ru.nl) or Jan-Mathijs Schoffelen (jan.schoffelen at donders.ru.nl).

If you like FieldTrip, you can **show your appreciation** by sending a postcard to:
